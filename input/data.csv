Activity patterns of the elusive and endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are not well understood. Using GPS collars equipped with dual-axis accelerometers on captive and wild giant pandas for the first time, we investigated the impact of day, season, and weather on wild panda activity in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China. Most pandas were not crepuscular as previously reported but had 3 apparent activity peaks, in the morning, afternoon, and around midnight. We found a peak in panda activity in June, then an apparent decrease in August and September, followed by an increase again from November to March of the following year. Activity patterns roughly corresponded to mean daily movement distances across seasons and movement behavior in a GPS-collared captive panda (studied to establish a baseline for interpreting collar-recorded activity of wild pandas). There was greater activity in times of higher solar radiation throughout every season, especially under cold conditions. This result suggests the potential for climate change to impact panda behavior in ways not previously reported. Our analysis also suggests that pandas may be constrained by tight energy budgets from their low-nutrient diet and may adjust their energy budgets by modifying their activity time and level across seasons. Our study has implications for understanding animal activity patterns across species, particularly relationships among forage, weather, and energy expenditure over time.",2015,10.1093/jmammal/gyv118,yes,accelerometer_remote,obs,Ailuropoda_melanoleuca,carnivore,mammal,"GPS, axy",5,40,,93934.4,726,A,yes,ethogram,"accelerometer, validation","used a captive panda to truth the axy data into behaviours, but ""foraging"" wasn't a behaviour type, only moving vs. feeding",

However, traditional statistical approaches used to conduct quantitative analysis have thus far had limited success in revealing underlying mechanisms driving activity patterns. Here, we combine wavelet analysis, a type of frequency-based time-series analysis, with high-resolution activity data from accelerometers embedded in GPS collars to explore the effects of internal states (e.g., pregnancy) and external factors (e.g., seasonal dynamics of resources and weather) on activity patterns of the endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Giant pandas exhibited higher frequency cycles during the winter when resources (e.g., water and forage) were relatively poor, as well as during spring, which includes the giant panda's mating season. During the summer and autumn when resources were abundant, pandas exhibited a regular activity pattern with activity peaks every 24hr. A pregnant individual showed distinct differences in her activity pattern from other giant pandas for several months following parturition. These results indicate that animals adjust activity cycles to adapt to seasonal variation of the resources and unique physiological periods. Wavelet coherency analysis also verified the synchronization of giant panda activity level with air temperature and solar radiation at the 24-hr band. Our study also shows that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for analyzing high-resolution activity pattern data and its relationship to internal and external states, an approach that has the potential to inform wildlife conservation and management across species.",2017,10.1002/ece3.2873,yes,accelerometer,obs,Ailuropoda_melanoleuca,carnivore,mammal,"GPS, axy",5,45,,107481.6,373.2,BC,yes,resting,activity,"axys measuring activity throughout the day, turned out to correlate with weather",
Gharnit_2020,"Gharnit, Elouana; Bergeron, Patrick; Garant, Dany; Reale, Denis",Exploration profiles drive activity patterns and temporal niche specialization in a wild rodent,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Individual niche specialization can have important consequences for competition, fitness, and, ultimately, population dynamics and ecological speciation. The temporal window and the level of daily activity are niche components that may vary with sex, breeding season, food supply, population density, and predator's circadian rhythm. More recently, ecologists emphasized that traits such as dispersal and space use could depend on personality differences. Boldness and exploration have been shown to correlate with variation in foraging patterns, habitat use, and home range. Here, we assessed the link between exploration, measured from repeated novel environment tests, activity patterns, and temporal niche specialization in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Intrinsic differences in exploration should drive daily activity patterns through differences in energy requirements, space use, or the speed to access resources. We used collar-mounted accelerometers to assess whether individual exploration profiles predicted: 1) daily overall dynamic body acceleration, reflecting overall activity levels; 2) mean activity duration and the rate of activity sequences, reflecting the structure of daily activity; and 3) patterns of dawn and dusk activity, reflecting temporal niche differentiation. Exploration and overall activity levels were weakly related. However, both dawn activity and rate of activity sequences increased with the speed of exploration. Overall, activity patterns varied according to temporal variability in food conditions. This study emphasizes the role of intrinsic behavioral differences in activity patterns in a wild animal population.

Due to its rarity, knowledge about its ecology and spatiotemporal activity is very fragmented. During two late-summer seasons, nine individuals were tracked using either radio-transmitters or GPS devices in an isolated population breeding in the Muranska planina Mts (Carpathians, Slovakia), which is an area characterized by distinct mountain landscape considerably different from the main species range. The bats roosted exclusively in mature aspen trees, Populus tremula, with decayed heartwood (n = 20 cavities in 18 trees) and located in sparse unmanaged natural mixed forests. Using GPS tracking technology (15-23 nights for each of three females), we found that the bats have large foraging home ranges (on average a minimum convex polygon 430 km(2), average of 95% kernel density estimate of 361 km(2)) and had long foraging transits (up to similar to 130 km) with large distance from the roosting area (up to similar to 49 km).

Graf_2016,"Graf, Patricia M.; Mayer, Martin; Zedrosser, Andreas; Hacklaender, Klaus; Rosell, Frank",Territory size and age explain movement patterns in the Eurasian beaver,MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY,"Territoriality is only profitable when the benefits gained from territory exploitation exceed the costs of defence, and territory sizes are usually optimized by time constraints related to resource defence (e.g. patrolling) and exploitation. In this study, we equipped 25 dominant Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) with GPS units to study spatial movement patterns both on land and in water in relation to territory size, resource availability, the number of neighbours, season, and the beavers' age. We show a territory size dependent trade-off between territorial behaviours and foraging distances: Beavers in larger territories moved greater distances each night, thereby spending more time patrolling, and stayed closer to the shoreline when being on land (i.e. when foraging). Inversely, in smaller territories beavers patrolled less and foraged further away from the shoreline. These results suggest that individuals trade-off the costs of patrolling larger territories against the benefits of foraging closer towards the shoreline. Smaller territories might be more prone to resource depletion, thus, making foraging further from the shoreline a strategy to ensure sustainable resource use. Further, older beavers spent more time on land and close to territory borders compared to younger ones, suggesting a behavioural change with age possibly due to increased experience and boldness.

W.; Martin, J.; Owen-Smith, N.","Lion proximity, not moon phase, affects the nocturnal movement behaviour of zebra and wildebeest",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,"Moon phase affects nocturnal activity patterns in mammals. Among ungulates, a number of studies have found animals to be more active over full moon nights. This may be because increased luminosity provides increased opportunity to forage and/or increased ability to detect predators; known as the visual acuity hypothesis. Here, we use GPS-derived movement data to test for the influence of moon phase on plains zebra Equus quagga and blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus activity in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We compare animal movement (rate and displacement) over full and new moon nights, and consider the effect of lion proximity. We found that lion proximity largely determined the nocturnal movements of zebra and wildebeest, not moon phase. When lions were >1km away, there was no difference in the nocturnal movement activity of prey animals over full and new moon conditions, contradicting previous findings. When lions were within 1km of these animals, however, the movement of zebra and wildebeest greatly increased over the new moon, the relatively dark period when lion were most likely hunting. Although we could not explicitly test for predator detection here, our findings suggest that the visual acuity hypothesis does not hold for zebra and wildebeest in Kruger National Park (KNP) given that there is no evidence for increased foraging activity over the full moon. The influence of moon phase on the nocturnal activity of African ungulates may be more complicated than anticipated, and we suggest that this cannot be estimated unless predator proximity is accounted for.",2016,10.1111/jzo.12343,yes,remote,obs,"Equus_quagga, Connochaetes_taurinus",ungulate,mammal,GPS,11,n/a,,789.4545455,468,C,yes,movement,"activity, movement, inferred_foraging","nocturnal movements assumed to be foraging, and those don't change with moonlight",
McGrath_2018,"McGrath, Diana J.; Terhune, Theron M., II; Martin, James A.",Northern bobwhite foraging response to hunting,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,"Prey species must consistently balance the need for resource acquisition with the threat of predation. This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014-March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (n=514) using radio-telemetry. We performed first-passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti-predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society. Northern bobwhites altered their foraging in response to increased levels of hunting pressure in an intensely managed landscape such that bobwhites increased the frequency of foraging but decreased the duration and area foraged.

Among the many advancements this revolution has brought is an ability to record behavioral responses of nocturnal, free-ranging species. Here, we combine captive validations of acceleration signatures with acoustic recordings from free-ranging individuals to classify behavior at two resolutions. Combining these classifications with similar to 2 month-long recordings, we describe winter time budgets, and responses of free-ranging snowshoe hares to changing moonlight. We successfully classified snowshoe hare behavior into four categories (not moving, foraging, hopping, and sprinting) using low frequency accelerometry, with an overall model accuracy of 88%, and acoustic recordings to three categories (silence, hopping, and chewing) with an accuracy of 94%. Broad-scale accelerometer-classified categories were composed of multiple fine-scale behavioral states with the composition varying between individuals and across the day. Time budgets revealed that hares spent similar to 50% of their time foraging and similar to 50% not moving, with most foraging and feeding occurring at night. We found that hares adjusted timing of activity in response to moon phase, with a 6% reduction in foraging and 30% reduction in traveling during the night when the moon was full. Hares compensated for this lost foraging time by extending foraging into the morning hours of the following day.

Recently, many Holarctic species, including white storks, Ciconia ciconia, were reported to overwinter at higher latitudes, closer to breeding grounds. We aimed to understand the causes and implications of this phenomenon by examining bird survival and behaviour during overwintering in Europe versus Africa. We compared GPS and body acceleration data of 54 juvenile (first-year) white storks that originated from the same European natal population and overwintered in Europe or Africa. All six juveniles that overwintered in Europe survived through their first year, which was significantly higher than only 38% of the 48 overwintering in the species' traditional grounds in Africa. During overwintering, storks in Europe differed from those in Africa by (1) reducing movement and foraging range, (2) spending less time flying and more time resting, thus using less energy (estimated from overall dynamic body acceleration) and (3) reducing foraging effort, while relying more on anthropogenic resources (landfills and agricultural areas). Timing affected overwintering site as juveniles that overwintered in Europe hatched and started migrating later. We emphasize, however, that late hatching by itself did not yield a survival benefit as not all late juveniles curtailed their migration. We suggest that wintering in Europe was less demanding compared to Africa which may explain the increased survival of juveniles that wintered in Europe. Our findings correspond to the general increase in the European wintering population of white storks, and shed light on the contemporary trend of shortened bird migration; a phenomenon with potentially broad ecological implications.

Despite decades of fieldwork, however, very little is known about how they make and use their foraging tools in the wild, which is largely owing to the difficulties in observing these shy forest birds. To obtain first estimates of activity budgets, as well as close-up observations of tool-assisted foraging, we equipped 19 wild crows with self-developed miniature video cameras, yielding more than 10 h of analysable video footage for 10 subjects. While only four crows used tools during recording sessions, they did so extensively: across all 10 birds, we conservatively estimate that tool-related behaviour occurred in 3% of total observation time, and accounted for 19% of all foraging behaviour. Our video-loggers provided first footage of crows manufacturing, and using, one of their most complex tool types-hooked stick tools-under completely natural foraging conditions. We recorded manufacture from live branches of paperbark (Melaleuca sp.) and another tree species (thought to be Acacia spirorbis), and deployment of tools in a range of contexts, including on the forest floor.

Costelloe_2018,"Costelloe, Blair R.; Rubenstein, Daniel I.",Temporal structuring of vigilance behaviour by female Thomson's gazelles with hidden fawns,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Prey animals often face a trade-off between investing time in antipredator behaviour and performing self-maintenance activities, such as foraging. Parents face particularly high stakes as they must protect highly vulnerable offspring while also meeting elevated energetic demands. To optimize this trade-off, the risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey should adjust their antipredator behaviour to reflect temporal fluctuations in risk. That is, they should invest more in antipredator behaviour when risk is high and prioritize other activities when risk is low. Here we investigate whether changes in risk level resulting from periodic fawn exposure drive maternal vigilance patterns in Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonn. We find that maternal vigilance patterns match the predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis. Mothers are highly vigilant prior to fawn retrieval, when risk of fawn detection by predators is high. They exhibit low levels of vigilance after fawns resume hiding, when certainty of predator absence is high and, therefore, risk is low. We suggest that fawn active periods may function secondarily as a form of predator sampling and that mothers may adjust their vigilance levels in response to information yielded by this sampling.

R.; Finch, Fiona M.; Britton, Adam; Raihani, Nichola J.",The influence of siblings on begging behaviour,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Elaborate solicitation displays are a common feature of interactions between care-givers and offspring. These displays are interpreted as the phenotypic expression of the conflict of interests between parents and offspring over parental investment. Offspring typically have siblings and thus do not exist in isolation. Therefore, they may adjust their begging in response to their siblings' begging, either competitively or cooperatively. Alternatively, begging may be independent of the begging efforts of siblings. Studies of avian begging have primarily focused on nestlings, where offspring are immobile and compete directly over the allocation of parental resources. We investigated the influence sibling begging had on individual fledgling begging in the cooperatively breeding pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor. Using experimental manipulations, we found that fledgling begging behaviour was negatively correlated with satiation and unrelated to the begging effort of siblings. Pied babbler care-givers were able to target increased provisioning to individuals with artificially increased demand while maintaining provisioning rates to the rest of the brood. Thus, fledglings were found to incur no provisioning costs or benefits from either increased or decreased begging by their siblings. We propose that the combination of targeted provisioning, flexible levels of provisioning and the dispersed nature of fledglings reduces the benefits of competitive or cooperative begging in this species.

Fitness payoffs of specialization vary with environmental conditions, but the underlying behavioral mechanisms are poorly understood. Such mechanistic knowledge, however, is crucial to reliably predict responses of heterogeneous populations to environmental change. We quantified spatiotemporal allocation of foraging behavior in wintering Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus), a species in which feeding specialization can be inferred from bill shape. We combined global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data to quantify foraging time of 64 individuals for every tidal period in one or two winter seasons. Individuals varied widely in foraging time (3.7-6.5 h per tidal period) and individuals that spend more time foraging had lower inferred survival. Feeding specialization appeared a major determinant of individual variation in foraging time and its spatiotemporal allocation. Visually hunting worm specialists foraged more during day time and complemented intertidal foraging with grassland foraging when the exposure of intertidal flats was limited and nights were well illuminated. Shellfish specialists increased total foraging time in cold weather, whereas foraging time of worm specialists decreased as frosty grasslands became inaccessible. Our results imply that worm specialists may be most sensitive to cold snaps and daytime disturbance, whereas shellfish specialists are most sensitive to high water levels. These behavioral responses can be implemented in population models to predict the vulnerability of heterogeneous populations to environmental change and, thereby, provide a shortcut to long-term population studies that require fitness data across many years and conditions to make similar projections. Lay Summary: Populations consist of different types of individuals. Predicting how heterogeneous populations of long-lived species respond to environmental change is hard as it takes decades to quantify how fitness varies among individuals in different environmental conditions.

Theory suggests that animals in populations limited by food availability should be energy maximizers in their foraging time allocation, while those regulated by predation should minimize their mobile activity levels. We compared daily and seasonal variation in activity states among three species of grazing ungulates coexisting in the same region of Kruger National Park, South Africa, and for one of these species between regions differing in rainfall. These grazers differed in body size and digestive physiology, potentially affecting their activity patterns. Hourly movement rates recorded by GPS telemetry were partitioned among activity states by applying independent mixture models. All three species showed activity peaks during the early morning and late afternoon, while resting prevailed pre-dawn as well as through midday. African buffalo showed the strongest diel variation in activity and greatest depression of midday activity, consistent with their large body size. Buffalo maintained similar levels of activity through the day and night, while zebra and sable antelope showed higher levels of diurnal than nocturnal activity. During the late dry season, zebra and coexisting sable, but not buffalo, showed elevated foraging and total mobile activity. Zebra devoted more time to foraging than both ruminants, consistent with greater food intake requirements for hindgut digestion. Sable antelope inhabiting the region with higher rainfall showed similar activity levels to the sable herd in the drier area, but slower rates of movement while foraging and travelling and less elevation in foraging time towards the end of the dry season.

Sex-specific behavioural differences are common in sexually dimorphic mammals, but have received limited research attention in monomorphic mammals where the sexes are similar in body size. Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) are obligate monogamous and monomorphic mammals and a good model species to study sex-specific differences. As females increase energy expenditure during reproduction, we hypothesized differing seasonal activity budgets, circadian activity rhythms and foraging patterns between male and reproducing female beavers. To test this hypothesis, we equipped adult beavers with VHF transmitters (N=41; 16 female, 25 male) and observed them throughout their active period at night from spring to late summer. Occurrence of their main activities (foraging, travelling and being in lodge) and use of food items (trees/shrubs, aquatic vegetation and herbs/grasses) were modelled to investigate sex-specific seasonal activity budgets and circadian activity rhythms. The sexes did not differ in time spent foraging across the season or night, but during spring, females resided more in the lodge and travelled less. Males and females both foraged on aquatic vegetation during spring, but females used this food source also during late summer, whereas males mostly foraged on trees/shrubs throughout the year. We conclude that seasonal activity budgets and foraging differ subtly between the sexes, which may relate to different energy budgets associated with reproduction and nutritional requirements. Such subtle seasonal behavioural adaptions may be vital for survival and reproduction of monomorphic species. Significance statement Activity budgets and foraging patterns of animals are key to their survival and may differ between males and females with different body sizes and physical requirements. In monomorphic species, where males and females have similar body sizes, fewer differences are expected, but may still be pronounced during certain times of the year. We modelled sex-specific seasonal activity budgets and circadian activity rhythms and use of food items in a monomorphic mammal, the Eurasian beaver. By treating season and time of day as a continuous variable rather than modelling differences within distinct predefined periods, we identified subtle sex-specific seasonal trends in activity budgets and use of food items.",2021,10.1007/s00265-021-03010-7,yes,telem,obs,Castor_fiber,rodent,mammal,"radio_tracking, direct_obs",41,4.8,1.379573171,,510,AB,yes,ethogram,"activity_budget, circadian, social",,KEY

Whereas studies on activity of these rodents under laboratory conditions almost exclusively have concerned themselves with the influence of light, many field studies have revealed signs of an association between the activity pattern and daily fluctuations of temperature under the ground. This would assume that behavioral thermoregulation is probably involved. The only exceptions to the relationship between temperature and activity are 2 eusocial mole-rats of the genus Fukomys (Bathyergidae, Rodentia), which indicates that activity patterns could be affected also by social cues. To better understand how social and environmental factors influence the activity pattern in a eusocial mole-rat, we monitored the outside-nest activity in another species of this genus, the Ansell's mole-rat (Fukomys anselli), which has a relatively small body mass, high conductance, and more superficially situated burrows. Its daily activity had 1 prominent peak (around 1400 h), and it was tightly correlated with the temperature measured at depth of foraging burrows. Since F. anselli has high thermoregulatory requirements to maintain stable body temperature below the lower critical temperature, we conclude that the observed pattern is probably the result of minimizing the cost of thermoregulation. There were no significant differences in the daily activity patterns of breeding males and females and nonbreeders. Members of the same family group tended to have more similar activity patterns, but consistent activity synchronization between individuals was not proven. From the comparison of available data on all subterranean rodents, we assume that social cues in communally nesting mole-rats may disrupt (mask) temperature-related daily activity rhythms but probably only if the additional cost of thermoregulation is not too high, as it likely is in the Ansell's mole-rat.",2014,10.1177/0748730414526358,yes,telem,obs,Fukomys_anselli,rodent,mammal,radio_tracking,17,n/a,,192,20,B,yes,resting,"activity_budget, circadian, social",,

We conducted radio-tracking surveys and direct observations of the Ryukyu flying fox, Pteropus dasymallus, in two different habitats-urbanized and forested areas-on a subtropical island from April 2002 to January 2006. We recorded the departure time and return time from/to day roosts as well as behavioral time budgets during the night. The departure and return times shifted in correspondence with seasonal changes in sunset and sunrise times. The Ryukyu flying fox tended to depart earlier in summer when the night length was shorter, suggesting that it adjusts its active period by departing earlier. On the contrary, the amount of foraging performed by the bats in urbanized areas decreased in the summer when fruits of Ficus microcarpa were more abundant, suggesting that the bats adjust their behavioral time budgets in line with local food availability. Daytime activity was observed only in the forested area.

Understanding a species' capacity for behavioural plasticity is therefore a key, but understudied, aspect of developing tractable conservation and management plans under climate-change scenarios. Here, we quantified behavioural differences between American pikas (Ochotona princeps) living in an atypical, low-elevation habitat versus those living in a more-typical, alpine habitat. With respect to foraging strategy, low elevation pikas spent more time consuming vegetation and less time caching food for winter, compared to high-elevation pikas. Low-elevation pikas were also far more likely to be detected in forested micro habitats off the talus than their high-elevation counterparts at midday. Finally, pikas living in the atypical habitat had smaller home range sizes compared to those in typical habitat or any previously published home ranges for this species. Our findings indicate that behavioural plasticity likely allows pikas to accommodate atypical conditions in this low-elevation habitat, and that they may rely on critical habitat factors such as suitable microclimate refugia to behaviourally thermoregulate. Together, these results suggest that behavioural adjustments are one important mechanism by which pikas can persist outside of their previously appreciated dietary and thermal niches.

To explain this phenomenon of rut-reduced hypophagia, two main hypotheses, the Foraging-Constraint Hypothesis and Energy-Saving Hypothesis, have been proposed. In our research, we assessed the behavioral strategy of goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa) through the rutting period. According to our findings, male goitered gazelles spent less time feeding during the rut compared to pre- and post-rut feeding times, but then maximized their energy intake during the rutting season when they were not engaged in rut-related behaviors. Females, in contrast, did not change their time budgets across the different stages of the rut. Therefore, rut-induced hypophagia is mainly arising from the constraints of rut-related behaviors for male goitered gazelles, so that the Foraging-Constraint Hypothesis better explains their strategy during rut.

Theory predicts an increase in food intake by lactating females, but very few studies have used contraceptives to experimentally test the influence of reproduction on foraging behaviour of wild mammals. From 2009 to 2011, we observed 182 individually marked female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, in two populations, including 29 that received an experimental contraceptive treatment. We sought to determine whether lactating females increase their foraging rate compared to contracepted and naturally nonlactating females. The proportion of time spent foraging during 10 min focal samples did not vary according to reproductive status in one population. In the other, lactating females spent 4% less time feeding than nonlactating females. Day and midday activity and bite and chewing rates were higher in lactating than in nonlactating females. Bite rate increased with the size of the pouch young and was higher for mothers of sons than for mothers of daughters. Bite rate was also affected by reproductive effort in the previous year, being higher for females that had weaned a young. Foraging behaviour was independent of body mass and group size, but bite rate appeared to decrease with female age. In one population, we found strong effects of date and year on foraging behaviour. Our study is a rare experimental manipulation of reproduction in free-ranging large mammals. We found that foraging behaviours were affected by both previous and current reproductive effort and varied with individual characteristics and environmental conditions.

Animals may adjust their temporal niche by shifting their activity patterns in relation to anthropogenic disturbance activities; however, few studies have recorded this response. We investigated the extent to which disturbances associated with pastoralism changed the timing of foraging and activity patterns of Himalayan marmot, a widely distributed rodent that inhabits alpine meadows in the mountains of central Asia. Using a scan-sampling observational approach, we collected data from 30 marmot sites in the Upper Mustang region of Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal. We developed an index of pastoralism intensity for each site, based on the presence of livestock, herders, guard dogs, distance from pastoralist camps, and density of major tracks. Using this index, marmot time spent above-ground, and foraging distance from burrows, was compared between high and low pastoralism sites. Using a linear mixed modeling approach, there was no significant difference between areas of high and low pastoralism in either the total daily activity time or foraging distance from burrows. However, marmots adjusted their diurnal patterns of activity and the distances moved from their burrows in relation to the timing of pastoralist activities (temporal niche shift). In areas experiencing high levels of pastoralism, marmots were less active during periods of herding activity, and compensated by increasing activity when herding activity was less. By changing foraging behaviors, any increase in pastoralism may have significant consequences in terms of marmot population viability.",2015,10.1093/beheco/arv083,yes,ethology,obs,Marmota_himalayana,rodent,mammal,direct_obs,103,30 points,0.297330097,,90,AB,no,ethogram,"activity_budget, ethogram, circadian, human_disturbance",,

This study is the first to describe the detailed daily feeding rhythm in proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) based on data collected from both riverbank and inland habitats. From May 2005 to May 2006, data on feeding behavior in a group of proboscis monkeys consisting of an alpha-male, six adult females and immatures was collected via continuous focal animal sampling technique in a forest along the Menanggul River, Sabah, Malaysia. In both the male and females, the highest peak of feeding activity was in the late afternoon at 15:00-17:00, i.e., shortly before sleeping. The differences in the feeding rhythm among the seasons appeared to reflect the time spent eating fruit and/or the availability of fruit; clearer feeding peaks were detected when the monkeys spent a relevant amount of time eating fruit, but no clear peak was detected when fruit eating was less frequent. The daily feeding rhythm was not strongly influenced by daily temperature fluctuations. When comparing the daily feeding rhythm of proboscis monkeys to that of other primates, one of the most common temporal patterns detected across primates was a feeding peak in the late afternoon, although it was impossible to demonstrate this statistically because of methodological differences among studies.",2014,10.1007/s10329-014-0407-5,yes,ethology,obs,Nasalis_larvatus,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, all_day_follow",7,n/a,89.47916667,,365,AB,yes,ethogram,"activity_budget, ethogram, social",,

Cohesive association with conspecifics increases intragroup feeding competition and may impose constraints on group size. Furthermore, in sexually dimorphic species, males and females may have different nutritional requirements, which can lead to suboptimal foraging in mixed-sex groups. How do animals living in permanent social groups mitigate these foraging costs? Niche differentiation is often hypothesized as a mechanism, but rigorous and detailed tests of the extent and context of differences in diet and habitat use, key tenets of this hypothesis, are rare. We investigated the potential for niche differentiation in foraging activity budget and environment use in a population of wild white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus imitator, in northwestern Costa Rica. Using a robust data set of 15 879 foraging scan samples collected from four groups over 13 months, we found that smaller individuals e.g. juveniles and females forage more often on smaller branches. We additionally found clear evidence of predator sensitive foraging wherein the smallest individuals spent less time on the ground during invertebrate foraging. Importantly, niche differentiation was far more evident overall during invertebrate foraging, likely due to spatial constraints and environmental homogeneity imposed by fruit patches. In summary, we found considerable variation in habitat use across age and sex classes, likely attributable to differences in size and relative predation risk. These variables likely reduce intraspecific feeding competition by promoting differential diet and habitat use. Our results also provide insight into the limits of niche differentiation as a strategy for competition reduction and may shed light on the evolution of fission-fusion dynamics in highly frugivorous species.

The causes of this segregation remain difficult to disentangle, despite numerous attempts. This is probably due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data on animal behaviour (e.g. habitat use, activity budgets) and group composition (age/sex and reproductive status) during the various phases of the species' reproductive cycle. Based on an intensive long-term monitoring of a Mediterranean mouflon, Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp., population, we concurrently assessed five hypotheses for segregation linked to forage selection (FSH), reproductive strategy (RSH), social preference (SPH), activity budget (ABH), and weather sensitivity (WSH). We found marked segregation between most age/sex classes. Age-dependent segregation among males was increasingly marked as their age difference increased and segregation between the sexes also increased as males became older and larger. Over the year, segregation between sex, age and reproductive status classes was lowest during the rut. We also observed the highest synchrony of activity in groups composed of individuals of similar age/sex class or reproductive status. Females occurred closer to both secure and high-quality food habitats, especially during the lambing and rearing periods, whereas males used less secure and lower quality habitats as they aged. Differences in habitat use between age/sex classes provided partial or full support for the RSH and FSH. Large males were preferentially observed at higher altitude than females during hot summer days to buffer against heat stress, in agreement with the WSH. A preference for interacting and grouping with peers that express similar activity patterns (ABH and SPH) appears to be the main driver of segregation in this population. Our study confirms the strong multifactorial nature of segregation in ungulates. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To interpret our results in the framework of foraging theory, we studied the influence of individual feeding rate on the decisions to move and to attack flock companions. Birds changed their position within the flock more often when their intake rate was low and sometimes attacked conspecifics to supplant them from their feeding place. Aggressors significantly avoided front attacks and were almost always successful. They attacked individuals having higher feeding rates than themselves and their own feeding rate significantly increased after the attack, although victims were not chased off to particularly poor sites. Our results suggest that aggressors could obtain reliable information about the quality of the foraging site they coveted by observing their victims feeding activity before attacking. Although aggression seemed to be caused by a low intake rate, we show that displacing another bird was more time-consuming than independent foraging. We conclude that it was not the most profitable behaviour in terms of energy intake. Foraging site displacement probably also had social functions, such as reinforcement of social status in a flock of birds preparing for pre-breeding migration.",2012,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01995.x,yes,ethology,obs,Limosa_limosa,shorebird,bird,direct_obs,30,0.04,0.010416667,,1,AB,no,vigilance,"activity_budget, ethogram, social, migratory_stopover","a single 15min sequence of a flock, bc no one could be IDd",

Heat-sensitive species may experience increasingly precarious trade-offs between investment in thermoregulation versus other key processes as the climate warms. We investigated the potential for trade-offs to exist between behavioral thermoregulation and foraging, studying a typical heat-sensitive endotherm: the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). Ibex use higher altitudes when it is hotter, which could restrict them from more profitable foraging areas at lower altitudes. We investigated this potential trade-off using data on the altitude-use and activity budgets of 43 marked males collected during the vegetation growing season in Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy. We used structural equation modeling to assess the support for models linking ambient temperature, altitude-use, vegetation productivity, and foraging time. Ibex migrated to higher altitudes during spring and summer, maintaining their ambient temperature within a very narrow band. Consequently, when it was warmer ibex utilized areas that were less productive, as indicated by lower normalized difference vegetation indices, and consumed lower quality forage, as indicated by lower levels of fecal crude protein. Ibex did not compensate behaviorally for reduced forage productivity by adjusting their foraging effort. We identify a trade-off between thermoregulation and foraging in ibex, which could affect this species negatively in the future. Such trade-offs could be a general phenomenon for heat-sensitive species.

Combining data on seed defecation or regurgitation rates by free-ranging individuals, the number of seeds in droppings or regurgitations of mist-netted birds, and the distances travelled by birds equipped with radio-transmitters, we estimated the potential spatial distribution of seeds generated by six resident males and six females or juveniles during the morning peak of lek activity and when lek activity decreased in the afternoon.

Changes in ambient light may hinder the effectiveness of particular senses (e.g., impaired vision at night), but many predators rely on multiple sensory systems and may continue to forage despite changes in light availability. Exactly how predator behaviors and sensory systems compensate under changes in light availability in the field is not well understood. We used radio telemetry and portable video surveillance cameras to quantify the sit-and-wait chemosensory foraging behavior of free-ranging red diamond (Crotalus ruber) and northern Pacific (Crotalus oreganus oreganus) rattlesnakes during day and night periods. The two most common behaviors we observed were chemosensory probes, a behavior we describe in detail for the first time, and mouth gapes. During chemosensory probes, rattlesnakes extend their head beyond their coil, explore the surrounding area while tongue-flicking, and subsequently return to a stationary position inside their coil. Foraging rattlesnakes probed at significantly higher rates during nocturnal vs. diurnal hours. Similarly, mouth gaping occurred during a higher percentage of nocturnal vs. diurnal hours for foraging snakes. Nearly half of all mouth gapes were followed immediately with a chemosensory probe, suggesting that mouth gaping also serves a chemosensory function in this context.

Among these challenges are those imposed by condor ground-foraging behavior that exposes them to environmental contamination. These include lead poisoning from the ingestion of spent ammunition and micro-trash ingestion and, during takeoff and landing, collisions with human structures. We tracked 28 California Condors for 24 months with patagially mounted GPS telemetry units to investigate the characteristics of ground sites condors visited and to identify spatiotemporal trends that might aid in conservation of this critically endangered species. Ground sites occurred on a wide variety of land cover types, primarily on steep slopes, and those more frequently used were associated with open cover.

Behavioral ecologists usually test this theory by examining outcomes, particularly whether the equilibrium fraction of animals in each alternative site equals the fraction of resource there (proportional settlement). Population ecologists instead focus on the relevant process: how does dispersion relate to resource distributions and is it density dependent? Isodar analysis is a process-focused method that assesses the relative roles of quantitative and qualitative factors in shaping density dependent settlement. Here, we apply isodar analysis to the dispersions of wild Thomson's gazelles foraging on natural swards in Kenya. Frequent and detailed mapping of resource levels allowed us to delineate rich and poor regions, and to record the densities of foraging females in each region throughout an annual cycle. Whereas quantitative differences attracted more foragers into the rich region at low-ambient densities, the poor region became increasingly favored at higher densities, implying the competing influence of a qualitative factor. Additional regressions suggested that this factor involved predation risk through the following scenario. Intakes were found to increase with proximity to ruminating conspecifics. The latter favored poor regions perhaps for improved predator detection.

When current information is unreliable, however, selection should favour unresponsive behavioural phenotypes, which might lead to the emergence of personalities. We tested the hypothesis that personality will affect decision making when information is unreliable, but not when it is reliable. We measured two personality traits, boldness and anxiety, in 55 wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, by quantifying responses to a novel food and a mild threat, respectively, in repeated field experiments. To assess decision making under different information reliabilities, we recorded foraging decisions in two contexts. We followed the baboons as they foraged naturally with reliable information about their environment (>8900 decisions) and, to manipulate information reliability experimentally, we performed a large-scale in situ foraging experiment during which we provided the study troops with access to experimental food patches (>10 000 decisions). Importantly, the baboons could not see the food in the experimental patches until close inspection of them, and thus had unreliable information about patch quality. We found plastic foraging decisions in the presence of reliable cues, but personality-dependent decisions in the absence of such cues. Specifically, bold individuals were more likely to produce, and shy individuals scrounge, in the experimental arena but there was no effect of personality on foraging decisions under natural foraging conditions. Our results clarify the importance of information reliability in the evolution of personality and plasticity. These findings also contribute to our understanding of how individuals, and thus populations, might respond to environmental change in the future.

Risk is likely perceived differently by individuals in relation to among-individual differences in correlated behavioral traits, that is, syndromes or personalities. Given that animals can avoid the risk of predation/disturbance through modification of their habitat use, we might expect individuals of differing behavioral types to adopt contrasting tactics of habitat use when faced with risky or stressful situations. We studied the relationship between habitat use and among-individual variation in behavioral profile in a population of roe deer. We hypothesized that an individual's habitat use tactics should be related to their capacity to cope with risky situations. In particular, we predicted that more reactive (risk-averse) roe deer, with relatively high behavioral response and high body temperature at capture, long flight distances and which were more vigilant during feeding, should use riskier open habitat less, particularly when risk is high. We found that although the use of open habitat during the day was negatively correlated with the indices of reactivity at capture, it was also positively correlated with indices of reactivity while foraging in open habitat. Furthermore, most of the behavioral parameters we measured were intercorrelated and moderately repeatable, potentially indexing personality traits. We conclude that there is substantial interindividual variability in how individuals manage risky situations which imposes constraints on how they are able to exploit high-risk habitats, suggesting the existence of a risk management syndrome in this large herbivore.",2015,10.1093/beheco/aru169,yes,ethology,obs,Capreolus_capreolus,ungulate,mammal,"direct_obs, GPS",25,120,0.006944444,,112,ABC,yes,vigilance,"activity_budget, individual_differences, habitat_selection","GPS and habitat yes, but also observed a subset of the collared animals for vig-feeding balance",

Occurrence of the group-size effect in a seasonally nongregarious forager,ETHOLOGY,"Group-living requires a compromise between safety and direct/indirect costs for individuals. The larger is the group, the greater is the collective vigilance, leading to a greater net food intake per forager because of the time saved individually from scanning behaviour. In turn, individual alertness usually decreases with increasing group size (group-size effect). Information on the occurrence of group-size effect is still unclear. Previous studies have shown that it may fail to occur or even reverse, for example when costs of interference between conspecifics are high. In turn, assessing whether the group-size effect would occur in weakly or seasonally gregarious species may help to understand its drivers. We evaluated the occurrence and the extent of group-size effect in a seasonally nongregarious herbivore, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus. We examined the roles of sex/age class and season as drivers of vigilance behaviour. In roe deer, the group-size effect did not depend on sex/age class: time spent foraging increased with increasing group size; in turn, vigilance increased with decreasing group size, in all sex/age classes. Females with fawns were the most vigilant sex/age class, thus revealing the cost of offspring protection. Accordingly, the higher spring vigilance levels of does could be related to reproductive costs (e.g., defence of newborn fawns). Conversely, the greater summer vigilance of bucks could result from patrolling/defence of territories. Both adult males and females also showed the higher vigilance in winter, likely because of an increase in the perception of predation risk and/or, possibly, hormones linked to an increase in intolerance of conspecifics, in males. However, the group-size effect occurred in all the seasons, for adult males and females. Our findings suggest that foraging benefits provided by the group-size effect may have overcome costs of group-living, even in a weakly gregarious forager.",2019,10.1111/eth.12844,yes,ethology,obs,Capreolus_capreolus,ungulate,mammal,direct_obs,642,1.31,0.067497404,,780,AB,no,vigilance,"activity_budget, intraspecific_variation",,

Previous work has established task-specific foraging advantages to different color vision phenotypes: dichromats (red-green colorblind) are more efficient foraging for invertebrates, while trichromats (color normal relative to humans) are more efficient foraging for reddish ripe fruit, suggesting that niche differentiation may underlie the maintenance of color vision variation. We explore a prediction of the niche differentiation hypothesis by asking whether dichromatic and trichromatic capuchin monkeys (Cebus imitator) diverge in their foraging activity budget, specifically testing whether dichromats forage more frequently for invertebrates and trichromats forage more frequently for reddish ripe fruit. To assess this, we analyze a large data set of behavioral scan samples (n = 21 984) from 48 wild adult female capuchins of known color vision genotype, dominance rank, and reproductive status, together with models of food conspicuity. We find no significant differences between dichromats and trichromats in the frequency of scans spent foraging for different food types but do find that nursing females forage less overall than cycling females. Our results suggest that the potential for color-vision-based niche differentiation in foraging time may be curtailed by the energetic requirements of reproduction, behavioral synchrony caused by group living, and/or individual preferences. While niche differentiation in activity budgets by color vision type is not apparent, fine-scale niche differentiation may be occurring.

For migrants to start breeding earlier, a concurrent advancement of migration is required, including premigratory fueling of energy reserves. We investigate whether barnacle geese are time constrained during premigratory fueling and whether there is potential to advance or shorten the fueling period to allow an earlier migratory departure. We equipped barnacle geese with GPS trackers and accelerometers to remotely record birds' behavior, from which we calculated time budgets. We examined how time spent foraging was affected by the available time (during daylight and moonlit nights) and thermoregulation costs. We used an energetic model to assess onset and rates of fueling and whether geese can further advance fueling by extending foraging time. We show that, during winter, when facing higher thermoregulation costs, geese consistently foraged at night, especially during moonlit nights, in order to balance their energy budgets. In spring, birds made use of the increasing day length and gained body stores by foraging longer during the day, but birds stopped foraging extensively during the night. Our model indicates that, by continuing nighttime foraging throughout spring, geese may have some leeway to advance and increase fueling rate, potentially reaching departure body mass 4 days earlier.

The northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus; Marsupialia: Peramelidae) is one of relatively few native Australian ground-dwelling mammals that is able to survive within urbanized landscapes. As a consequence of extensive clearing and urban development within the city of Brisbane, bandicoots are now restricted to the mostly small (<10 ha) bushland fragments scattered across the city landscape. Our study examined the behavioural ecology of northern brown bandicoots within habitat fragments located on a major creek-line, using mark-recapture population monitoring and radio telemetry. Bandicoots at monitored sites were found to occur at high densities (typically one individual ha(-1)), although one-third of the populations were transient. Radio tracking revealed that bandicoots had relatively small home ranges (mean 1.5 +/- 0.2 ha) comprised largely of bushland/grassland with dense, often weed-infested ground cover. Bandicoots sheltered by day in these densely covered areas and also spent most time foraging there at night, although they occasionally ventured small distances to forage in adjacent maintained parklands and residential lawns. We suggest that introduced tall grasses and other weeds contribute to high habitat quality within riparian habitat fragments and facilitate the persistence of high density populations, comprised of individuals with small home ranges. The generalized dietary and habitat requirements of northern brown bandicoots, as well as a high reproductive output, undoubtedly facilitate the survival of the species in urban habitat fragments.

Yet owls' cryptic behavior has led to uncertainties about their basic ecology, including foraging, communication, and functional roles within the community, and potentially hindered the implementation of effective conservation measures. Here we demonstrate the potential for next-generation GPS tags capable of recording high-precision, minute-by-minute locations paired with other technologies to resolve some of these uncertainties. We combined high-precision GPS tagging data with infrared (IR) video recorded by arboreally-mounted cameras at 5 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) nest sites in the Sierra Nevada, USA to provide a uniquely detailed examination of owl foraging patterns. Our approach allowed us to identify the precise time and location of 54 predation events and prey identity. We also used high-precision GPS tags with on-board audio recorders to map the vocal activity of 8 individuals by matching the time of vocalizations in the audio data to GPS locations recorded at one-minute intervals. The combined spatial and acoustic data revealed that nonbreeding males had the most widespread territorial vocal activity (i.e., producing 4-note territorial calls), while females provisioning fledglings displayed extensive nonterritorial vocal activity (i.e., producing many contact calls). Thus, the GPS-tag technologies we employed can provide opportunities to better understand owl foraging, communication, territoriality, and population dynamics. The methods we describe are time- and resource-intensive but can be paired with techniques that are more applicable at landscape scales, such as stable isotope analyses, LiDAR-based habitat analyses, and passive acoustic monitoring to link local processes to broad-scale ecological patterns. Therefore, our approach could be applied to many species whose behavior inhibits direct observation.

However, studies that explicitly test the temporal scale over which foragers track changes in prey availability are surprisingly rare. The increasingly well-recognized impact of terrestrial predators (e.g., birds) on intertidal food webs is likely to depend on their ability to track prey fluctuations in these highly variable environments. Here, we compare the predictions of 2 optimal diet models: a classic model in which prey encounter rate estimates are based on long-term, site-level abundance averages, and a model in which encounter rate estimates change at regular intervals throughout the foraging period. We parameterized these models using data from a field study on glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens) foraging on various sizes of the sea star Pisaster ochraceus. Predictions from the classic model, which assumes constant diet breadth throughout the tide cycle, did not match field observations of diet breadth. The tide-sensitive model, which assumes that gulls track tide-related changes in prey abundance, provided a better fit to observational data, explaining the full range of Pisaster sizes consumed by gulls. We conclude that gulls track short-term changes in prey encounter rates within a single low tide period to maximize foraging returns.

Furthermore, adult orangutans show sex-specific dispersal and activity patterns. This study investigates sex differences in adult foraging behavior and sheds light on how these differences develop in immatures. We analyzed 11 years of feeding data on ten adult female, seven flanged male, and 14 immature Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) at Tuanan in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that the diets of the adult females were significantly broader and required more processing steps before ingestion than the diets of flanged males. We also found evidence for a similar difference in overall diet repertoire sizes. For the immatures, we found that whereas females reached 100% of their mothers' diet spectrum size by the age of weaning, males reached only around 80%. From the age of 4 years on (i.e., years before being weaned) females had significantly broader daily diets than males. We found no difference in daily or overall diet processing intensity of immature males and females but found preliminary evidence that immature males included fewer items of their mother's diet in their own diets that were processing-intensive. Overall, our results suggest that by eating a broader variety and more complex to process food items, female orangutans go to greater lengths to achieve a balanced diet than males do. These behavioral differences are not just apparent in adult foraging behavior but also reflected in immature development from an early age on. Significance Statement In many species, males and females have different nutritional needs and are thus expected to show sex-specific foraging behavior. Sex differences in several aspects of foraging behavior have been found in various species, but it remains largely unclear when and how those develop during ontogeny, which is especially relevant for long-lived altricial species that learn foraging skills over many years. In our study, we analyzed a cross-sectional and longitudinal data set containing more than 750,000 feeding events of adult and immature Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We found that adult females had significantly broader and more complex diets than males.

We examined how birds make movement decisions by integrating aspects of flight biomechanics, movement ecology and behaviour in a hierarchical framework investigating flight track variation across several spatio-temporal scales. Using extensive global positioning system and accelerometer data from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) in Israel and France, we examined soaring gliding decision-making by comparing inbound versus outbound flights (to or from a central roost, respectively), and these (and other) home range foraging movements (up to 300 km) versus long-range movements (longer than 300 km). We found that long-range movements and inbound flights have similar features compared with their counterparts: individuals reduced journey time by performing more efficient soaring gliding flight, reduced energy expenditure by flapping less and were more risk-prone by gliding more steeply between thermals. Age, breeding status, wind conditions and flight altitude (but not sex) affected time and energy prioritization during flights. We therefore suggest that individuals facing time, energy and risk trade-offs during movements make similar decisions across a broad range of ecological contexts and spatial scales, presumably owing to similarity in the uncertainty about movement outcomes.

In sexually size-dimorphic species living in these areas, the larger males have more difficulties in dissipating body heat and reducing evaporative water loss. This occurs in the great bustard (Otis tarda), the most sexually size-dimorphic bird. A previous study showed a correlation between summer temperature at breeding areas and northward migration to cooler areas only in males, providing strong evidence for their lower heat tolerance compared with females. However, not all males migrate, and here, we investigate the behavioral adaptations that help sedentary males to withstand summer heat. Males showed a stronger dependence on vegetation providing shade than females at midday. All males searched for shade after the morning foraging period, whereas only two-thirds of the females did it, entering shade 1 h later than males. Males foraged less intensively, moved shorter distances between foraging and resting locations, and flew less than females. The use of shade is the main cause of the observed sexual differences in microhabitat selection in summer, whereas lower food intake, and reduced locomotor and flight activity represent additive factors affecting spatial and social segregation.

Our results showed that during the rut males also reduced lying time, while the ratio of time spent feeding to time spent lying did not change for males among periods.

However, some studies suggested that the number of neighbours under surveillance may play a more important role in affecting food intake rate than flock size. In addition, the effect of the number of neighbours should also depend on the position of an individual within a flock. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of flock size, number of neighbours and position within a flock on foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate of wintering greater white-fronted geese, Anser albifrons. We observed the foraging behaviours of 490 individual geese from 71 flocks during December 2016-March 2017 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui, China. We found that mean foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate were not influenced by flock size, whereas, at the individual scale these variables were significantly affected by the number of neighbours and position within a flock. Moreover, the effect of the number of neighbours on the foraging parameters did not differ between central and peripheral individuals, despite central individuals always having greater foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate regardless of the number of neighbours. Both the decreased foraging time and decreased foraging efficiency indicated a potential increase in cryptic competition from neighbours. More neighbours contributed to a decreased intake rate. Our study highlights the possible effects of cryptic competition among neighbours on their foraging behaviour. We hypothesize that an increase in intraspecific competition between neighbours in areas of shrinking wetland habitats may contribute to population declines of wintering geese and other wildfowl.

Here, we aim to quantify variation in individual spacing behaviour and its correlates in a group of wild Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) in north-eastern Thailand, which experiences both predation pressure and within-group feeding competition. Data on individual spatial positions were collected during group scans using GPS devices and results suggest that both group cohesiveness and individual spatial positions within a group can be adjusted to mediate the costs and benefits of group living. Individuals had greater nearest neighbour distances and lower numbers of close neighbours when the group was feeding, compared to when the main group activity was resting/social or moving. This is likely due to the high costs of proximity associated with feeding competition. Immature individuals and females with young infants which are more vulnerable to predation were located closer to the centre of the group than both adult males and females without infants. This indicates the importance of predation risk in driving individual spatial position. Among adults, higher ranking individuals occupied more central positions within the group while lower ranking individuals were more peripheral. It appears that low ranking individuals trade reduced feeding interference and improved feeding success for increased predation risk.

Whereas good evidence is available to support the link between social relations and cognition in mammals, it remains unsatisfying for birds. Here we investigated the role of avian social bonds in a nonbreeder aggregation of ravens, Corvus corax, in the Austrian Alps. We individually marked 138 wild ravens, representing approximately half of a population that uses the area of a local zoo for foraging. For 2 years, we observed the dynamics of group composition and the birds' agonistic and affiliative interactions. We identified two levels of organization: the formation of an unrelated local group and the individuals' engagement in social bonds of different length and reciprocity pattern. Whereas belonging to the local group had no significant effect on conflicts won during foraging, the individual bonding type did. Birds that engaged in affiliative relationships were more successful when competing for food than those without such bonds. Bonded birds did suffer from aggression by other bonded birds and, probably as a consequence, most of the ravens' social relations were not stable over time. These results support the idea that social bonding and selective cooperation and competition are prominent features in nonbreeding ravens.

Food availability, weather, photoperiod and endogenous factors relevant to the biological cycle of individuals have been shown as major drivers of temporal changes in activity rhythms and group size/structure of herbivorous species. We evaluated how diurnal female foraging activity and grouping patterns of a mountain herbivore, the Apennine chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, varied during a decreasing gradient of pasture availability along the summer-autumn progression (July-October), a crucial period for the life cycle of mountain ungulates. Females increased diurnal foraging activity, possibly because of constrains elicited by variation in environmental factors. Size of mixed groups did not vary, in contrast with the hypothesis that groups should be smaller when pasture availability is lower. Proportion of females in groups increased, possibly suggesting that they concentrated on patchily distributed nutritious forbs. Occurrence of yearlings in groups decreased, which may have depended on dispersal of chamois in this age class. Presence of kids in groups did not show variation through summer-autumn, suggesting a close mother-juvenile relationship even at the end of weaning and/or, possibly, low summer mortality.

Many previous studies have focused on how ecological and social factors influence activity budget at the individual or group level in various species. However, few primate studies have focused on multiple study groups living within a similar habitat. Here, we analyse group, season and sex effects on the individual activity budget of wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) living in four groups with overlapping home ranges. Generally, our findings support previous studies on primates. Our results indicate that intragroup competition may force larger groups to spend more time feeding and less time resting. We also found that seasonal variation, and therefore food availability, has a strong influence on the monkeys' activity budget. Females, which are the philopatric sex in vervet monkeys, spent more time socializing while, in general, males spent more time resting. However, we did not find any difference on the time spent socializing between groups. Since there is evidence that not only time constraints and habitat quality but also group size influence individual behaviours and ultimately group living, we advise that future studies should focus on multiple groups of the same species living in the same habitat in order to better understand how all these variables are interlinked.",2019,10.1111/eth.12946,yes,ethology,obs,Chlorocebus_pygerythrus,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",60,4 points,1.552777778,1118,660,AB,yes,ethogram,"activity_budget, social",,

These differences can involve consistent variation in the level of a particular behaviour (personality) or differences in the way individuals adjust their behaviour to environmental gradients (plasticity). In prey species, feeding rates and vigilance vary with environmental, social and individual factors and the feeding rate/vigilance relationship reflects the trade-off between food acquisition and safety. While feeding rates and vigilance have been shown to vary between individuals in relation to group size and predation risk, how they relate to other factors has not yet been investigated, nor has between-individual variation in this trade-off. We studied between-individual variation in vigilance, feeding rates and their trade-off in female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, to see whether females showed consistent behavioural differences and different plasticity in relation to ecological (food patch richness), social (group sizes) and physiological (reproductive states) conditions. We addressed two contrasting hypotheses: an 'ecological' hypothesis under which individuals facing the same conditions should behave similarly, and a 'behavioural' hypothesis under which they should behave differently because of their own personality or plasticity. Female kangaroos tended to adjust their behaviours similarly in relation to ecological and social conditions, supporting the ecological hypothesis. However, they also showed differences in personality and plasticity in relation to their reproductive states that could not be explained by energetic demand alone; this was suggestive of different maternal strategies, thus supporting the behavioural hypothesis. Altogether these results suggest that consistent differences in animals' personality and behavioural plasticity can be promoted by physiological conditions and are not necessarily repeatable across different ecological contexts.

Therefore, a detailed description of basic feeding ecology in as many populations as possible is necessary and warrants further understanding. The black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) or guereza is widely distributed in Africa and is one of the well-studied colobines in terms of their feeding; they demonstrate considerable variation in their diets in response to local conditions. We studied the diet of a group of guerezas in the Kalinzu Forest, Uganda, for over 30 consecutive months using behavioral observation (4308 h in total), phenology, and vegetation surveys. A total of 31 plant species were consumed by the study group. This study group was predominantly folivorous; the majority of their feeding time was involved in feeding on young leaves (87%). However, during certain times of the year, fruits and seeds accounted for 45% of monthly feeding time. Young leaves of Celtis durandii were by far the most important food, which constituted 58% of the total feeding records. There was a significant increase in the consumption of fruits and flowers once young leaf availability was low, but their consumption of fruits did not significantly increase even when fruit availability was high. Their monthly dietary diversity increased as the number of available plants with young leaves declined, suggesting that much of the dietary diversity in the study group may be attributable to the young leaf portion of their diet.

Our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been shown to have functionally referential food calls in captivity but evidence for such capabilities in the wild is lacking. We investigated the context specificity and function of West African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, food calls in the wild using all day focal follows of adult males and females of one habituated group in the Tai forest, Cote d'Ivoire. We collected over 750 h of observation and analysed 379 food calls produced for five different food species and found that higher pitched calls were produced for a single fruit species. Additionally, within this species, chimpanzees modified calls according to tree size, whereby smaller trees elicited higher pitched calls. Our results suggest that chimpanzees subtly vary the acoustic structure of food calls with respect to food patch size for a putatively highly valued fruit species, and we propose that arousal alone cannot sufficiently explain the patterns observed. Further work is needed to determine whether variation in food call pitch can influence receiver foraging behaviour. However, in light of our results, we propose that understanding the information content encoded by acoustic variation in chimpanzee food calls requires receiver knowledge about the natural ecological context, specifically spatial memory of tree locations. Therefore, this study highlights the potential significance of feeding ecology in the evolution of flexibly modulated vocal communication. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Although delayed juvenile dispersal occurs in non-cooperative breeders, studies investigating family formation in these species are rare. Juveniles delay natal dispersal in response to ecological constraints of dispersal and/or benefits of philopatry, with parents predicted to adjust their tolerance towards independent offspring according to their direct fitness benefits. Consequently, precocial chick development is often associated with low parental care and short family association. White-breasted mesites (Mesitornis variegata) are group-living but non-cooperatively breeding birds that live in saturated habitats, whose semi-precocial young exhibit large variation in the timing of natal dispersal. We investigated whether the development of foraging skills of nutritionally independent juvenile mesites affects their dispersal decisions. Additionally, because parents show aggression towards older offspring particularly around the subsequent breeding season, we studied whether family-living is costly for parents. Our results indicate that juveniles develop their foraging skills slowly, that juveniles with poorer foraging skills tend to disperse later, and that adults experience foraging and reproductive costs from extended juvenile association. Therefore, it may be beneficial for less skilled juveniles to remain longer in the safety of the family when breeding vacancies are scarce. Furthermore, parental costs of family-living may trigger parental aggression towards juveniles, resulting in the dissolution of families and the lack of cooperative breeding in this species. This study highlights the importance of cost-benefit analyses from both the parents' and offspring's perspective to understand family stability and, hence, evolutionary routes towards cooperative breeding.",2015,10.1007/s00265-015-1943-8,yes,ethology,obs,Mesitornis_variegata,ratite,bird,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",31,n/a,0.007777778,,42,AB,yes,vigilance,"activity_budget, social, development",,

For most mammal species, it is unknown how these factors contribute to sex differences in feeding, or how the development of males and females reflects these intraspecific feeding differences. We show changes in dietary composition, diversity, overlap, and foraging behavior throughout development in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and test how the development of sex differences in feeding is related to female costs of reproduction and year-round resource partitioning. Sex differences in dietary composition were only present when females were lactating, but sex differences in other aspects of feeding, including dietary diversity, and relative time spent feeding and foraging, developed at or near the time of weaning. Sex difference in juveniles and subadults, when present, were similar to the differences found in adults. The low year-round dietary overlap and early differences in dietary diversity indicate that some resource partitioning may begin with young individuals and fluctuate throughout development. The major differences between males and females in dietary composition suggest that these larger changes in diet are closely tied to female reproductive state when females must shift their diet to meet energetic and nutritional requirements.",2014,10.1007/s00265-014-1738-3,yes,ethology,obs,Lemur_catta,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",78,0.00132,1.228632479,,330,AB,yes,ethogram,"activity_budget, social, development",,

The mechanisms mediating these paternal effects remain unclean Here, we investigated whether father offspring associations might facilitate offspring access to resources in wild desert baboons (Papio ursinus). We combined paternity analyses and behavioral observations of juveniles that had started feeding autonomously to show that (1) offspring associate more often with their genetic father than with any other male, and actively manage such associations, (2) offspring associate more closely with their father when another adult male is in sight, and when their mother is out of sight, (3) father offspring associations are more frequent when juveniles are feeding (relative to other activities), and these associations enable juveniles to access richer food patches, and (4) father offspring associations are stronger among subordinate males and their offspring. Taken together, these findings indicate that fathers may buffer the social and ecological environment faced by their offspring.

M.",Pattern and variation of the time budget of yellow-bellied marmots,ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,"We measured the time budgets of yellow-bellied marmots to determine what constraints limited energy acquisition and whether trade-offs occurred among the behaviors. Therefore, we focus on which behaviors form a consistent pattern among marmot populations, the degree of phenotypic plasticity in the time allocated to the behaviors, and the biotic and abiotic factors associated with variations in time allocations. Time budgets for 14 behaviors were recorded at six sites in the Upper East River Valley in western Colorado over two active seasons. Data were analyzed for cohort, day-period and season-period, and for interactions among the main effects. Sitting and vigilance, accounting for 63% of aboveground activity, are strongly associated with wariness, the need for marmots to monitor the presence of conspecific and predatory intruders. Foraging accounts for 15% of daily activity. These three activities are the major contributors to time budgets at all sites. Radiation, acting as a thermal constraint, greatly reduces activity during mid-day when radiation is intense. Sitting is the only major behavior to increase at mid-day, presumably to maintain wariness. Time allocations change little over the season-periods and foraging does not significantly increase in the weeks prior to hibernation. Young generally are less vigilant, often spend less time sitting and forage less than adults, but generally allocate more minutes to investigation. Time is a seasonal but not a daily constraint. Thermal constraints reduce overall daily activity, and digestive constraints limit foraging time. Sitting provides a reservoir of time that can be drawn upon when needed for other behaviors such that costly trade-offs are not evident. Time allocations for an activity may differ among sites; these differences and most significant differences, whether for cohort, day-period or season-period, are associated with the behaviors of a particular age/sex group, such as high time allocation to investigation by immigrant males.",2016,10.1080/03949370.2015.1059894,yes,ethology,obs,Marmota_flaviventris,rodent,mammal,"direct_obs, focal_sampling, ethogram",6,n/a,2.416666667,,194,AB,no,ethogram,"activity_budget, social, dominance,ethogram",only gives total obs time for 3 of the 6 populations,

Focused learning from mothers and other group members is critical in monkeys, with behaviours such as co-feeding playing strong roles in determining postweaning survival. While adult lemurs are capable of social learning, it is unknown how social information is incorporated during the development of feeding or what social learning strategies are used in this process. Here we evaluate the use of social learning behaviours and the potential for social learning in young ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. We show that infant and juvenile ringtailed lemurs use basic and generalized stimulus enhancement that occurs through behavioural synchrony with older nearest neighbours. More focused co-feeding occurred at low levels, and many of the social learning behaviours observed in the other social primate taxa were absent. High levels of individual exploration also contributed to learning, evidenced through high dietary diversity in juveniles relative to other group members. Our observations are consistent with the idea that simple social learning rules are responsible for the development of ecological complexity in many generalist vertebrate species, and that more complicated learning behaviours may not be necessary to learn complex and varied diets.

Under predation risk, the optimal position for an individual in a stationary group is at the group's centre. The resulting group geometry is circular, with individual placement determined by competitive ability. Where it compromises efficient foraging, a long-standing question has been whether this topology can deform adaptively in response to the local distribution of resources. Here we show that the shape described by a group of foraging chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, changes in response to habitat structure and that this promotes foraging efficiency while conserving the predation-risk-related distribution of group members. Adult baboons improve unimpeded access to the small, dispersed food items found in grassland by adjusting both their interindividual distances and their relative positions along the line of movement in order to forage in rank formation. Dominant animals occupy the centre of the group and do so regardless of its geometry. Our results demonstrate that spatially explicit data can address emergent group level properties directly. This global approach complements analyses of individual action and can help direct the search for potential local rules of interaction. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Exploring factors affecting behavior between phylogenetically related common and threatened species could help understand such discrepancy. We tested for effects of external and internal variables including month, time of day, habitat type, distribution area, group composition status and group size on vigilance behavior (including group scan frequency and level) of two sympatric common Gres gnus and threatened G. nigricollis cranes with generalized linear models. We detected significant species effect on group scan level, and grus was more vigilant than nigricollis. Model tests also indicated that group size had common effect on group scan frequency for both species, and distribution area significantly correlated with the vigilance of nigricollis, while grus was more affected by time of day and group composition status in areas of sympatry with nigricollis. But when nigricollis was absent, time had no effects on behavior by individuals belonging to grus, implying existence of inter-specific competition. We also found that grus decreased individual vigilance efforts by foraging with other species (e.g., Bar-headed Goose Anser indicus) to share large group alertness benefits (collective vigilance). As our results demonstrated, we argued that, with diverse antipredation tactics e.g., foraging with other species, alternating time rhythm or partitioning spatial utilization to mitigate inter-specific competition, reducing time allocation to preening while maintaining foraging efforts, common grus could maintain high level of vigilance, which may benefit their survival and population increase.

I studied willow warblers (Phylloscopus trochilus) that regularly sing on their African wintering grounds to test this supposition using a combination of behavioral experiments and radio telemetry. Contrary to expectations for individual territory defense, I found that individuals foraged in conspecific groups with fluid group membership, moved itinerantly from site to site rather than remaining in stable territories, and were highly aggressive toward model presentations combined with song playback, but in groups rather than individually. These results suggest a puzzling alternative function for winter song-singing for group territory defense-where territories are short term and group membership is not fixed.

While modelling exercises may contribute to understanding such dynamics at large spatial scales, they rarely offer insights into the mechanisms that prompt the process at a local scale. Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii) is a vespertilionid bat widespread throughout the Mediterranean region. The species' recent range expansion towards northeastern Europe is thought to be induced by urbanization, yet no study actually tested this hypothesis, and climate change is a potential alternative driver. In this radio telemetry study, set in the Vesuvius National Park (Campania region, Southern Italy) we provide insights into the species' thermal physiology and foraging ecology and investigate their relationships with potential large-scale responses to climate, and land use changes. Specifically, we test whether H. savii i) exploits urbanisation by selecting urban areas for roosting and foraging, and ii) tolerates heatwaves (a proxy for thermophily) through a plastic use of thermoregulation. Tolerance to heatwaves would be consistent with the observation that the species' geographic range is not shifting but expanding northwards. Tracked bats roosted mainly in buildings but avoided urban habitats while foraging, actively selecting non-intensive farmland and natural wooded areas. Hypsugo H. savii showed tolerance to heat, reaching the highest body temperature ever recorded for a free ranging bat (46.5 degrees C), and performing long periods of overheating. We conclude that H. savii is not a strictly synurbic species because it exploits urban areas mainly for roosting, and avoids them for foraging: this questions the role of synurbization as a range expansion driver. On the other hand, the species' extreme heat tolerance and plastic thermoregulatory behaviour represent winning traits to cope with heatwaves typical of climate change related weather fluctuations.",2018,10.1016/j.beproc.2018.06.002,yes,telem_biologger,obs,Hypsugo_savii,bat,mammal,"radio_tracking, temperature_logger",12,85,3,35,3,BC,yes,resting,"activity_budget, temperature_logger",,

These studies, however, do not include direct observations of the aboveground activity of these rodents. Moreover, studies into the factors that influence the movement of these subterranean rodents outside of their burrow systems are relatively scarce.

Grazing by domestic stock can directly influence and shape the functions of an ecosystem. Most remaining remnant native grasslands in Australia are under some form of grazing management, with some possible adverse impacts for endemic grassland biota. For the endangered pygmy bluetongue lizard (Tiliqua adelaidensis), grazing of its remnant native grassland habitat has been seen as a potential conservation threat. Aim. We aimed to investigate whether lizards altered their basking and foraging behaviour as a response to simulated grazing of the grassland habitat surrounding their burrows. Methods. We used field manipulations over 3 years event by manually removing above-ground vegetation in 1 m(2) around occupied lizard burrows, to simulate intense grazing events. We video-recorded lizard responses to these manipulations. We filmed lizards before and after the simulated grazing event and monitored basking and foraging response. We also simultaneously filmed a control group of lizards that were not exposed to a simulated grazing event. Key results. Although overall time spent basking did not differ between treatment and control groups, the lizards spent more of their basking time completely emerged (bold basking) in the grazing treatment, suggesting they changed behaviour after simulated grazing. Perhaps they were more confident of evading predators that they could more clearly see approaching. In one season lizards made more attempts to catch prey in the grazed treatment than in a control treatment following the treatment, suggesting that grazing might enhance visibility for the ambush predation method that these lizards use. Conclusions. The results suggest that grazing may produce some benefits for lizards already established in burrows. This contrasts with some previous results and suggests that management of grazing regimes requires careful consideration of the conditions currently prevalent. In this case, the study was conducted during a drought period, and different results might have emerged in higher rainfall years. Implications.

To determine which characteristics enable its success, we investigated space use and activity budgets of seven free-ranging individuals living in semi-natural and urban habitats within a large city. We did not find significant differences in animals' space use between habitat types but tendencies towards smaller home ranges and increased home range overlap existed among individuals in the urban site. Squirrels differed between sites in both overall activity levels and temporal activity patterns: urban animals spent less time active and activity onset was later compared to semi-natural conspecifics. This is likely explained by a combination of dense and reliable supplementary food sources in the urban habitat, reducing foraging effort, and restrictions to movement imposed by higher fragmentation. Flexibility in space use and activity budgets, as well as the ability to exploit anthropogenic food sources and tolerate reduced habitat connectivity, are likely the most important factors contributing to the squirrels' success in cities. Accordingly, these traits could be used as indicators of low sensitivity towards urbanisation when assessing other species' potential resilience. However, they do not immunise squirrels against extirpation. Further research on individuals' foraging ecology and population health may reveal possible threats to urban red squirrels and help predict their future persistence in this challenging habitat.",2018,10.4404/hystrix-00065-2018,yes,telem,obs,Sciurus_vulgaris,rodent,mammal,radio_tracking,7,2.054,,129.5714286,77,AB,yes,resting,"activity_budget, urban, movement",,
Siers_2018,"Siers, Shane R.; Adams, Amy A. Yackel; Reed, Robert N.",Behavioral differences following ingestion of large meals and consequences for management of a harmful invasive snake: A field experiment,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Many snakes are uniquely adapted to ingest large prey at infrequent intervals. Digestion of large prey is metabolically and aerobically costly, and large prey boluses can impair snake locomotion, increasing vulnerability to predation. Cessation of foraging and use of refugia with microclimates facilitating digestion are expected to be strategies employed by free-ranging snakes to cope with the demands of digestion while minimizing risk of predation. However, empirical observations of such submergent behavior from field experiments are limited. The brown treesnake (Serpentes: Colubridae: Boiga irregularis) is a nocturnal, arboreal, colubrid snake that was accidentally introduced to the island of Guam, with ecologically and economically costly consequences. Because tools for brown treesnake damage prevention generally rely on snakes being visible or responding to lures or baits while foraging, cessation of foraging activities after feeding would complicate management. We sought to characterize differences in brown treesnake activity, movement, habitat use, and detectability following feeding of large meals (rodents 33% of the snake's unfed body mass) via radio telemetry, trapping, and visual surveys. Compared to unfed snakes, snakes in the feeding treatment group showed drastic decreases in hourly and nightly activity rates, differences in refuge height and microhabitat type, and a marked decrease in detectability by trapping and visual surveys. Depression of activity lasted approximately 5-7 days, a period that corresponds to previous studies of brown treesnake digestion and cycles of detectability. Our results indicate that management strategies for invasive brown treesnakes need to account for cycles of unavailability and underscore the importance of preventing spread of brown treesnakes to new environments where large prey are abundant and periods of cryptic behavior are likely to be frequent.

Despite the fact that nest predator communities are often diverse, recent evidence from studies of snakes that are nest predators has lent some support to the link between snake activity and nest predation. However, the strength of the relationship has varied among studies. Explaining this variation is difficult, because none of these studies directly identified nest predators, the link between predator activity and nest survival was inferred. To address this knowledge gap, we examined seasonal variation in daily survival rates of 463 bird nests (of 17 bird species) and used cameras to document predator identity at 137 nests. We simultaneously quantified seasonal activity patterns of two local snake species (N=30 individuals) using manual (2136 snake locations) and automated (89,165 movements detected) radiotelemetry. Rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus), the dominant snake predator at the site (similar to 28% of observed nest predations), were most active in late May and early June, a pattern reported elsewhere for this species. When analyzing all monitored nests, we found no link between nest predation and seasonal activity of rat snakes. When analyzing only nests with known predator identities (filmed nests), however, we found that rat snakes were more likely to prey on nests during periods when they were moving the greatest distances. Similarly, analyses of all monitored nests indicated that nest survival was not linked to racer activity patterns, but racer-specific predation (N=17 nests) of filmed nests was higher when racers were moving the greatest distances. Our results suggest that the activity of predators may be associated with higher predation rates by those predators, but that those effects can be difficult to detect when nest predator communities are diverse and predator identities are not known. Additionally, our results suggest that hand-tracking of snakes provides a reliable indicator of predator activity that may be more indicative of foraging behavior than movement frequency provided by automated telemetry systems.",2016,10.1002/ece3.1992,yes,telem,obs,"Pantherophis_obsoletus, Coluber_constrictor",snake,reptile,radio_triang,30,8,,1752.615385,547.5,BC,yes,resting,"activity_pattern, circadian","also included nest box videos, but not really a metric of snake foraging as much as the tracking is",

However, few studies have investigated how spatiotemporal scales and movement/activity patterns shape responses to this food/cover trade-off while accounting for individual characteristics (e.g. sex) and for variation in predation risk (e.g. hunting) and in resource abundance/quality. We hence studied temporal changes in habitat selection of 30 GPS-collared females and 15 males of Mediterranean mouflon, Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp., at two scales, i.e. 48 h home range selection within a subpopulation area (broad scale) and choice of movement steps (defined as the linear segment between two consecutive locations) according to activity state (fine scale), in southern France. During the hunting-free/food-abundant period, males selected at both scales the foraging habitats providing the best conditions for optimizing their future reproductive success and only selected areas perceived as safe during inactive steps. During the corresponding lambing period, and at both scales, females selected areas perceived as safe that should optimize lamb survival. They switched to the best foraging habitats only when lambs were weaned and only for active steps. By contrast, during hunting, when food was also scarce, both sexes selected home ranges with high proportions of the habitats perceived as safe, in which they performed all their activities. This result suggested that risk avoidance exceeded all the other individual and environmental factors in the hierarchy of the determinants of habitat selection during the hunting period. Coupling scale-specific habitat selection and activity patterns was hence decisive in disclosing how individuals fulfil their specific needs under seasonally changing levels of habitat attributes important for fitness.

Stable-isotope evidence suggests Red Knots from different wintering areas partially segregate at the site, with short-distance migrants concentrating on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey rather than in Delaware Bay itself. The Red Knot has been little studied on the Atlantic coast, and our objectives were to determine the extent to which birds captured on the coast used Delaware Bay and to characterize their habitat use and behavior. In 2006, we radio-tracked birds captured on an Atlantic beach and collected behavioral data and prey samples for comparison to those at randomly selected plots within Red Knot habitat. Depending on tidal stage, the distribution of Red Knot locations was skewed toward either Atlantic marshes or beaches. It was skewed away from Delaware Bay on the falling tide. Red Knots observed in Delaware Bay were foraging, whereas birds on the Atlantic coast were equally likely to forage or rest on rising and high tides. On the Atlantic coast, Red Knot locations had significantly more prey items than did random points, but this was not so on Delaware Bay beaches.

In response to these three nonlinear phenomena, grackles decreased their relaxed behavior (walking, foraging, and preening) and increased looking. A second experiment looked at the rapidity of the time course of frequency change and found that the abrupt frequency jump from 3 to 1kHz, as opposed to a gradual downward frequency modulation over the same bandwidth, was uniquely arousing.

Meerkats attend to contextual information in close calls to coordinate vigilance,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Socio-demographic factors, such as group size and their effect on predation vulnerability, have, in addition to intrinsic factors, dominated as explanations when attempting to understand animal vigilance behaviour. It is generally assumed that animals evaluate these external factors visually; however, many socially foraging species adopt a foraging technique that directly compromises the visual system. In these instances, such species may instead rely more on the acoustical medium to assess their relative risk and guide their subsequent anti-predator behaviour. We addressed this question in the socially foraging meerkat (Suricata suricatta). Meerkats forage with their head down, but at the same time frequently produce close calls ('Foraging' close calls). Close calls are also produced just after an individual has briefly scanned the surrounding environment for predators ('Guarding' close calls). Here, we firstly show that these Guarding and Foraging close call variants are in fact acoustically distinct and secondly subjects are less vigilant (in terms of frequency and time) when exposed to Guarding close call playbacks than when they hear Foraging close calls. We argue that this is the first evidence for socially foraging animals using the information encoded within calls, the main adaptive function of which is unrelated to immediate predator encounters, to coordinate their vigilance behaviour. In addition, these results provide new insights into the potential cognitive mechanisms underlying anti-predator behaviour and suggest meerkats may be capable of signalling to group members the 'absence' of predatory threat. If we are to fully understand the complexities underlying the coordination of animal anti-predator behaviour, we encourage future studies to take these additional auditory and cognitive dimensions into account.",2011,10.1007/s00265-011-1202-6,yes,ethology,exp,Suricatta_suricatta,carnivore,mammal,direct_video,18,n/a,0.025,,150,AB,yes,vigilance,alarm_call_playback,played alarm calls vs. foraging calls to see if they distinguish - they do,

The present study directly compares how grey squirrels respond to cues of these risks while foraging. We simulated social risk and predatory risk using acoustic playbacks of stimuli that grey squirrels might be exposed to at a foraging patch: calls of conspecifics, heterospecifics (competitor and non-competitor) and predators. We found that grey squirrels responded to predator, heterospecific competitor and conspecific playbacks by altering their foraging and vigilance behaviours. Foraging was most disrupted by increased vigilance when we played calls of predators. Squirrels' response to calls of heterospecific competitors did not differ from their response to conspecific calls, and they resumed foraging more quickly after both compared to predator calls: whereas they showed little response to calls of non-competitor heterospecifics and a white noise control. We conclude that squirrels respond differentially to calls made by conspecifics, heterospecific competitors and predators, with the most pronounced response being to calls of predators. We suggest that squirrels may view conspecific and corvid vocalisations as cues of potential conflict while foraging, necessitating increased vigilance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conspecifics detecting these calls respond with increased vigilance, promoting predator detection and evasion, but in doing so, lose time from foraging.

For juvenile ground squirrels, we predicted that the trade-off between foraging and vigilance could be optimized via selective response to alarm calls emitted by their own dam, and/or neighboring colony members over calls broadcast by less familiar conspecifics. Alarm calls of adult female Richardson's ground squirrels were elicited in the field using a predator model and recorded on digital audio tape. Free-living focal juveniles were subjected to playbacks of a call of their mother, and on a separate occasion a call from either another adult female from their own colony, or an adult female from another colony. Neither immediate postural responses and escape behavior, nor the duration of vigilance manifested by juveniles differed with exposure to alarm calls of the three adult female signaler types.

While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex, age and dominance status, shorter-term social, internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important. Sentinel behaviour, where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage, offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context-dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour. Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience, satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to investigate how sentinel contributions are modulated by individual context. In addition to standard measures of sentinel behaviour (likelihood of becoming a sentinel, number of bouts, bout duration), we considered within-bout behaviour in terms of surveillance calls and attentiveness (head-scanning rate and distraction levels). We found that the presence of a neighbouring forager (audience) decreased sentinel contributions, while individuals increased their sentinel investment when satiated and experiencing an increased danger level. Changes in head-scanning rate provided evidence for an interaction between the effect of satiation and danger levels, demonstrating that sentinel attentiveness was influenced by changes in context. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour is strongly context dependent, with effects seen in initial bout and bout quantity decisions, as well as within-bout characteristics, and that individual contributions to group behaviours can vary depending on social, internal and environmental factors.

Individuals must decide when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare. We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue, however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call, potentially because of social information novelty.

However, the evolutionary causes of this behaviour remain unclear. There are two main, competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of sentinel behaviour. The first hypothesis is that it is a cooperative behaviour, where group members benefit from the detection of danger but share the workload of acting as a sentinel. The second is that it is a safe, selfish behaviour. Under the second hypothesis, once an individual is satiated, being a sentinel is safer because sentinels can detect threats more readily and can therefore escape from predators faster. We examined whether sentinels are safer than foragers in a wild, free-living cooperative bird (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) with a well-described sentinel system. We found that sentinel behaviour was costly because (1) sentinels were targeted by predators more often, (2) they were further from cover than foragers, and (3) they took longer to reach the safety of cover following a predator alarm. These results suggest that individuals do not become sentinels because it is safer. This is the first study to demonstrate that sentinels are at greater risk of predator attack than foraging group members and suggests sentinel activity may have evolved as a form of cooperative behaviour.

These behaviours are often interpreted as predator-deterrent signals-honest signals that indicate to a predator that continued hunting is likely to be futile. However, many of these putative predator-deterrent signals are given when no predator is present, and it remains unclear if and why such signals deter predators. We examined the effects of one such signal, the tail-flag display of California ground squirrels, which is frequently given both during and outside direct encounters with northern Pacific rattlesnakes. We video-recorded and quantified the ambush foraging responses of rattlesnakes to tail-flagging displays from ground squirrels. We found that tail-flagging deterred snakes from striking squirrels, most likely by advertising squirrel vigilance (i.e. readiness to dodge a snake strike). We also found that tail-flagging by adult squirrels increased the likelihood that snakes would leave their ambush site, apparently by elevating the vigilance of nearby squirrels which reduces the profitability of the ambush site. Our results provide some of the first empirical evidence of the mechanisms by which a prey display, although frequently given in the absence of a predator, may still deter predators during encounters.",2012,10.1098/rspb.2012.1112,yes,audio video,obs,Crotalus_oreganus,snake,reptile,"direct_video, radio_tracking",15,2 points,,1.933333333,178,A,yes,resting,"ambush, antipredator_response",used vhf to find snakes and then filmed them,

Although much research has focused on snake foraging, only a handful of detailed studies have been conducted on free-ranging individuals, all on Crotalus horridus. We used fixed videography to collect data on free-ranging Northern Pacific Rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus) behavior to qualitatively test predictions regarding interspecific differences in rattlesnake foraging behavior. We analyzed foraging behaviors based on encounter rates with prey and strike rates on prey, distances moved between consecutive ambush sites, residency time at each site, and poststrike behaviors. Snakes encountered approximately 4 prey/d, with California Ground Squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) being encountered at much higher rates than other prey types. Crotalus oreganus typically did not remain at hunting sites for long durations compared with other species, and generally exhibited short distance movements (<10 m) to new sites. Snakes initiated strikes during 21% of all prey encounters, and 49% of these strikes were successful. Snakes were more likely to hold on to nonsquirrel prey than squirrels after a strike. When snakes struck and released prey, the distance prey fled after a strike was positively related to the time snakes spent locating the envenomated prey.

Behavioral data on free-ranging individuals is necessary to determine at what temperatures animals modify activity as this would determine their capacity to continue to move, forage, and mate under altered thermal regimes. In particular, high temperatures could limit available surface activity time and time spent on fitness related activities. Conversely, performance, such as feeding rate, can increase with temperature potentially having positive fitness effects. Here, we examine how the hunting behaviors of free-ranging Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) associate with air temperature and body temperature. We continuously recorded snakes in the field using videography, capturing behaviors rarely considered in past studies such as movements in and out of refuge and strikes on prey. We found that as mean daily air temperature increased, hunting activity and the likelihood of hunting at night decreased, while the number of movements and distance moved per day increased. Snakes typically retreated to refuge before body temperatures reached 31 C. Body temperatures of snakes hunting on the surface were lower compared to temperatures of non-hunting snakes in refuge in the morning, while this relationship was inverted in the afternoon. Snake body size influenced the disparity of these temperatures. Finally, strike initiation and success occurred across a wide range of body temperatures, indicating hunting performance may not be strongly constrained by temperature.

Hence, the mating system of wild bears remains poorly understood. Animal-borne camera systems (i.e., cameras mounted on animals) provide novel tools to study the behavior of elusive animals. Here, we used an animal-borne video system to record the activities of wild bears during the mating season. Video camera collars were attached to four adult Asian black bears (male A and B, and female A and B) captured in Tokyo, central Japan, in May and June 2018. The collars were retrieved in July 2018, after which the video data were downloaded and analyzed in terms of bear activity and mating behavior. All the bears were found to interact with other uniquely identifiable bears for some of the time (range 9-22 days) during the deployment period (range 36-45 days), and multiple mating in males was documented. Both males and females exhibited different behaviors on social days (i.e., days when the bear interacted with conspecifics) compared with solitary days (i.e., days with no observed interactions with conspecifics). Compared with solitary days, the bears spent a lower proportion of time on foraging activities and higher proportion of time on resting activities on social days. Our results suggest that Asian black bears have a polygamous mating system, as both sexes consort and potentially mate with multiple partners during a given mating season.

Although substantial evidence exists for intraspecific variation in responses to other anthropogenic disturbances, this possibility has received relatively little experimental attention with respect to noise. Here, we used field-based playbacks with dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to test how traffic noise affects vigilance behavior and to examine potential variation between individuals of different age class, sex, and dominance status. Foragers exhibited a stronger immediate reaction and increased their subsequent vigilance (both that on the ground and as a sentinel) in response to traffic-noise playback compared with ambient-sound playback. Traffic-noise playback also resulted in sentinels conducting longer bouts and being more likely to change post height or location than in ambient-sound playback. Moreover, there was evidence of variation in noise responses with respect to age class and dominance status but not sex. In traffic noise, foraging pups were more likely to flee and were slower to resume foraging than adults; they also tended to increase their vigilance more than adults. Dominants were more likely than subordinates to move post during sentinel bouts conducted in traffic-noise trials. Our findings suggest that the vigilance-foraging trade-off is affected by traffic noise but that individuals differ in how they respond.

Reactions to vertebrate pseudopredators in red-nosed cuxius (Chiropotes albinasus), a high-canopy neotropical primate",ETHOLOGY,"Predation on primates is considered to have far-reaching effects on the foraging and social ecology of a species. Primate species display a variety of responses to predator proximity and attack, ranging from active physical defense and mobbing, to flight and concealment. Warning calls are often given, and potentially threatening animals may be tracked, either actively or with head movements. Such behaviors take time that could be used for other activities. Accordingly, there should be strong selection to respond only to those species that represent a genuine threat. However, primates give defense-based behaviors to non-predator species. We tested the hypotheses that responses to pseudopredators are (i) precautionary calls made by individuals following the Dinner/Life Principle, or (ii) represent the ontogeny of species recognition. Of the species that ellicted a response from the cuxius, 80% resembled a primate predator; 95% of the encounters that elicited a response from the cuxius occurred when the distance between the pseudopredator and cuxius was 20m. In regard to the frequency of responses to pseudopredators, we found no difference between adults and juveniles (47.6% and 52.4%, respectively) and no differences between adult males and adult females (60% and 40% of the responses, respectively). However, reactions to pseudopredators were of shorter duration (+/- standard error (SE): 42.2 +/- 15.9s) than were reactions to actual predator species +/- SE: 1,024.3 +/- 329.1s). There were only three instances where alarm calls were made to species that did not resemble predators, and 66.7% (N=2) were made by adult cuxius and only 33.3% (N=1) were made by a juvenile cuxiu. Therefore, we found partial support for the Dinner/Life Principle hypothesis, but no support for the ontogeny hypothesis.

Foragers, therefore, face a challenge to balance between two conflicting tasks, namely energy intake and safety. Flight initiation distance (FID, defined as the distance between a prey and a predator when the prey starts to flee) has been widely measured in many taxa to study such economic trade-offs. However, FID may also be affected by limitations on the prey's ability to detect predators, especially when there is visual obstruction caused by surrounding vegetation. Although both vegetation cover and vegetation height may contribute to such obstruction, the effect of vegetation height on FID has not been well studied. In this study, we explored the effects of vegetation height, vegetation cover and distance to refuge on FID in free-living Daurian ground squirrels (Spermophilus dauricus) inhabiting a grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. Multiple linear regressions suggested that both vegetation height and distance to refuge significantly affected FID in S. dauricus. Ground squirrels fled earlier when vegetation was low or when foraging farther away from a refuge. No significant effect of vegetation cover on FID was detected.

The model predicts that latency to flee increases as cost of fleeing increases and decreases as cost of remaining immobile increases. As predation risk increases, cost of fleeing, primarily due to abandoning crypsis due to immobility, decreases. Predictions have been tested for few risks and a single cost of immobility factor in only two species of active foragers. To gauge the breadth of applicability of the model, we tested effects of four risk factors and two cost of immobility factors in ambush-foraging phrynosomatid lizards, which we selected for testing because foraging mode strongly affects many aspects of ecology and behavior of lizards. Latency to flee decreased as standing distance (predator-prey distance before fleeing) decreased, predator approach speed increased, directness of approach increased, and predator persistence increased. Latency to move was shorter in the presence of food and shorter for males in the presence of females. Lizards often moved toward food or females instead of fleeing. Latency was affected as predicted by all risk and by cost of remaining immobile factors. Our findings agree with previous results for the same four risk factors and the foraging cost of immobility. That social cost of immobility affects latency as predicted is a novel finding.

Their behaviour suggests that gulls perceive little risk around people and so we examined whether opportunity costs, that is access to anthropogenic food sources, influence risk monitoring and escape responses in Silver Gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) around outdoor restaurants ('food' sites), where the gulls would scavenge food from people. We recorded alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) and compared them with nearby sites where the same cohort of gulls was not interacting with people ('no-food' sites). We used two approach speeds (with the prediction that gulls would take greater efforts to avoid a potential predation threat when approached at speed). Gulls foraging at food sites had lower AD and FID than those approached at no-food sites. They were not simply ignoring the person, as they demonstrated longer AD when approached at speed but no difference in FID and therefore appeared to be responding to a small geographic scale 'behavioural footprint' of anthropogenic influences.

We performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to explore the relationships between environmental factors and ADs and FIDs. Both behavioral responses were significantly lower for House sparrows. Although we did not find significant relationships between the assessed variables (sex, flock size, environmental factors) and bunting ADs and FIDs, we did find House sparrow males to be bolder (showing shorter ADs and FIDs), as well as larger ADs and FIDs for sparrows with increasing flock size. House sparrow ADs and FIDs were positively related with herbaceous plant cover and negatively related with minimum building height. In general, House sparrows showed to be bolder than Orange-breasted buntings, with differential responses of the sparrow related with sex, flock size, and different environmental factors. Having recorded bolder House sparrow males could be due to increases in aggressiveness related to the breeding season.

While much research has examined variation in mobbing responses to different predators, few studies have investigated how anti-predator behavior is affected by changes in a predator's own state or behavior. We examined the effect of sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) behavior on the mobbing response of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) using robotic taxidermy sparrowhawks. We manipulated whether the simulated predator moved its head, produced vocalizations, or held a taxidermy blue tit in its talons. When any sparrowhawk model was present, blue tits decreased foraging and increased anti-predator behavior and vocalizations. Additionally, each manipulation of the model predator's state (moving, vocalizing, or the presence of a dead conspecific) impacted different types of blue tit anti-predator behavior and vocalizations. These results indicate that different components of mobbing vary according to the specific state of a given predator-beyond its presence or absenceand suggest that each might play a different role in the overall mobbing response. Last, our results indicate that using more life-like predator stimuli-those featuring simple head movements and audio playback of vocalizations-changes how prey respond to the predator; these 'robo-raptor' models provide a powerful tool to provide increased realism in simulated predator encounters without sacrificing experimental control. Significance statement Anti-predatory behavior is often modulated by the threat level posed by a particular predator. While much research has tested how different types of predators change prey behavior, few experiments have examined how predator behavior affects anti-predatory responses of prey. By experimentally manipulating robotic predators, we show that blue tits not only respond to the presence of a sparrowhawk, by decreasing feeding and increasing anti-predator behavior and vocalizations, but that they vary specific anti-predator behaviors when encountering differently behaving predators (moving, vocalizing, or those with captured prey), suggesting that prey pay attention to their predators' state and behavior.",2017,10.1007/s00265-017-2361-x,yes,ethology,exp,Cyanistes_caeruleus,passerine,bird,direct_obs,12,12 points,0.104166667,,22.28,AB,no,vigilance,"antipredator_response, predator_simulation, playback","at birdfeeders, but 'naturally' occuring ones on the landscape, not ones set up by the authors",
Beauchamp_2010a,"Beauchamp, Guy",Determinants of false alarms in staging flocks of semipalmated sandpipers,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"False alarms occur when animals flee abruptly upon detection of a threat that subsequently proved harmless. False alarms are common in many species of birds and mammals and account for a surprisingly high proportion of all alarms. False alarms are expected to be more frequent in larger groups, where the odds of misclassifying threats are higher, and under environmental conditions where detection of threats is compromised, such as low light levels. In addition, false alarms should be less frequent when the energetic cost of fleeing increases. I examined these hypotheses in roosting flocks of staging semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) over 2 years. False alarms increased with group size but the effect of group size was confounded by the fact that more attacks by falcons (Falco spp.) were directed at larger roosts. False alarms were more frequent at low light levels and later during staging. As individuals double their body mass during staging, the energetic cost of fleeing must greatly increase thus contributing to decreased responsiveness. A simple reduction in responsiveness caused by repeated exposures to harmless signals would also produce a temporal decrease in responsiveness but this hypothesis cannot account for the effect of group size and light level.

Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species.

Numerous studies attempted to model it [2-7] with little supporting evidence. Studying it in the wild is difficult because it requires monitoring the animal's movement, its foraging success, and its interactions with conspecifics. We present a novel system that enables full night ultrasonic recording of freely foraging bats, in addition to GPS tracking. As they rely on echolocation, audio recordings of bats allow tapping into their sensory acquisition of the world [8]. Rapid changes in echolocation allowed us to reveal the bats' dynamic reactions in response to prey or conspecifics-two key behaviors that are extremely difficult to assess in most animals. We found that bats actively aggregate and forage as a group. However, we also found that when the group became too dense, bats were forced to devote sensory attention to conspecifics that frequently entered their biosonar field of view, impairing the bats' prey detection performance. Why then did bats fly in such high densities? By emitting echolocation calls, bats constantly provide public information about their detection of prey. Bats could therefore benefit from intentionally flying at a distance that enables eavesdropping on conspecifics. Group foraging, therefore, probably allowed bats to effectively operate as an array of sensors, increasing their searching efficiency [4, 6]. We suggest that two opposing forces are at play in determining the efficient foraging density: on the one hand, higher densities improve prey detection, but on the other hand, they increase conspecific interference.",2015,10.1016/j.cub.2014.11.010,yes,audio video_remote,obs,Rhinopoma_microphyllum,bat,mammal,"GPS, audio_logger",9,200,,n/a,1,BC,yes,resting,audio_recorder,"foraging buzzes from onbody recorder are good estimate, but no mention of GPS fix rate or how long they were worn",

In summer, ibex moved upslope, tracking the green wave. Ibex decreased diel activity sharply above a threshold temperature of 13-14 degrees C, indicating thermal stress, but compensated behaviourally by foraging both earlier and later in the day, and by moving further upslope than on cooler days, especially reproductive females. This critical temperature will be exceeded three times as often under climate change projections.

Flying foxes often persist in anthropogenic areas where other wildlife has vanished, and where they play a significant ecological role in vegetation regeneration in disturbed habitats. Detailed knowledge on the foraging behavior of flying foxes is crucial for understanding how they survive in degraded habitats and for the management of human-wildlife conflicts. Thailand still harbors large colonies (several thousand individuals) of Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei), a species ranked as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, at temples situated in agricultural landscapes. We used high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) loggers to study the movement and foraging behavior of this species at 2 temples in central Thailand during 2 seasons. We analyzed GPS and acceleration data of 19 tagged individuals, and assessed habitat use and diet. Foraging individuals commuted between day roosts and foraging areas each night, followed by small-scale movements in foraging areas, and showed high site fidelity during the study period. Maximum linear distances between day roosts and foraging areas varied greatly between individuals (2.2-23.6km) but were similar between seasons. Tracked bats mostly foraged in farmland, plantations, and gardens, yet our data indicate that small mangrove remnants constitute important habitat components for Lyle's flying fox. We recorded a highly diverse diet of 34 food plant species, comprised of exotic crops and native plants as available. Our results suggest that conservation and landscape managers should preserve remaining native trees and natural vegetation in the study area as resources for Lyle's flying fox, at the same time reducing potential for conflicts between bats and humans on crops. They can further be used for public information campaigns integrating the potential of Lyle's flying fox as dispersers of useful plants and the human health risks through zoonotic diseases associated with hunting and consumption of this species.

During such windows of relaxed top-down and/or bottom-up control, ungulate populations can grow rapidly, eventually leading to resource depletion and density-dependent expansion into less-preferred habitats. Although many studies have explored the demographic outcomes and ecological impacts of these processes, fewer have examined the individual-level mechanisms by which they occur. We investigated these mechanisms in Gorongosa National Park, where the Mozambican Civil War devastated large-mammal populations between 1977 and 1992. Gorongosa's recovery has been marked by proliferation of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), an historically marginal 200-kg antelope species, which is now roughly 20-fold more abundant than before the war. We show that after years of unrestricted population growth, waterbuck have depleted food availability in their historically preferred floodplain habitat and have increasingly expanded into historically avoided savanna habitat. This expansion was demographically skewed: mixed-sex groups of prime-age individuals remained more common in the floodplain, while bachelors, loners, and subadults populated the savanna. By coupling DNA metabarcoding and forage analysis, we show that waterbuck in these two habitats ate radically different diets, which were more digestible and protein-rich in the floodplain than in savanna; thus, although individuals in both habitats achieved positive net energy balance, energetic performance was higher in the floodplain. Analysis of daily activity patterns from high-resolution GPS-telemetry, accelerometry, and animal-borne video revealed that savanna waterbuck spent less time eating, perhaps to accommodate their tougher, lower-quality diets. Waterbuck in savanna also had more ectoparasites than those in the floodplain. Thus, plasticity in foraging behavior and diet selection enabled savanna waterbuck to tolerate the costs of density-dependent spillover, at least in the short term; however, the already poorer energetic performance of these individuals implies that savanna occupancy may become prohibitively costly as heterospecific competitors and predators continue to recover in Gorongosa. Our results suggest that behavior can provide a leading indicator of the onset of density-dependent limitation and the likelihood of subsequent population decline, but that reliable inference hinges on understanding the mechanistic basis of observed behavioral shifts.",2021,10.1002/ecm.1476,yes,accelerometer_remote_video,obs,Kobus_ellipsiprymnus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, axy, video_logger, fecal_analysis, camera_trap",22,4000,730,,730,ABC,yes,movement,"axy, activity_budget, diet_composition, fecal_analysis","GPS to get habitat selection; axy gets behavioural state; fecal analysis to get metabarcoding composition; trail cams get bite rate and vigilance... collar specs are in non-included Appendix, but seems they were followed two years",

Due to the importance of light and temperature cycles in shaping activity patterns, studies of activity patterns of organisms that inhabit extreme environments with respect to the 24-hour cyclicity of Earth have the potential to provide important insights into the interrelationships among abiotic variables, behaviour and physiology. Our previous laboratory studies with Argentinean tuco-tucos from the Monte desert (Ctenomys aff. knighti) show that these subterranean rodents display circadian activity/rest rhythms that can be synchronized by artificial light/dark cycles. Direct observations indicate that tuco-tucos emerge mainly for foraging and for removal of soil from their burrows. Here we used bio-logging devices for individual, long-term recording of daily activity/rest (accelerometry) and time on surface (light-loggers) of six tuco-tucos maintained in outdoor semi-natural enclosures. Environmental variables were measured simultaneously. Activity bouts were detected both during day and night but 77% of the highest values happened during the daytime and 47% of them coincided with time on surface. Statistical analyses indicate time of day and temperature as the main environmental factors modulating time on surface. In this context, the total duration that these subterranean animals spent on surface was high during the winter, averaging 3 h per day and time on surface occurred when underground temperature was lowest. Finally, transport of these animals to the indoor laboratory and subsequent assessment of their activity rhythms under constant darkness revealed a switch in the timing of activity.

While the accelerometer's high sensitivity to movement and fast response times present the unprecedented opportunity to resolve fine-scale behaviour, leveraging this opportunity will require overcoming the challenge of developing general, automated methods to analyse the nonstationary signals generated by nonlinear processes governing erratic, impulsive movement characteristic of fine-scale behaviour. We address this issue by conceptualising fine-scale behaviour in terms of characteristic microevents: impulsive movements producing brief (<1 s) shock signals in accelerometer data. We propose a 'seek-and-learn' approach: a novel microevent detection step first locates where shock signals occur ('seek') by searching for peaks in envelopes of acceleration data. Robust machine learning ('learn') employing meaningful features then separates microevents. We showcase the application of our method on tri-axial accelerometer data collected on 10 free-living meerkatsSuricata suricattafor four fine-scale foraging behaviours - searching for digging sites, one-armed digging, two-armed digging and head jerks during prey ingestion. Annotated videos served as groundtruth, and performance was benchmarked against that of a variety of classical machine learning approaches. Microevent identification (mu EvId) with eight features in a three-node hierarchical classification scheme employing logistic regression at each node achieved a mean overall accuracy of >85% during leave-one-individual-out cross-validation, and exceeded that of the best classical machine learning approach by 8.6%. mu EvId was found to be robust not only to inter-individual variation but also to large changes in model parameters. Our results show that microevents can be modelled as impulse responses of the animal body-and-sensor system. The microevent detection step retains only informative regions of the signal, which results in the selection of discriminative features that reflect biomechanical differences between microevents. Moving-window-based classical machine learning approaches lack this prefiltering step, and were found to be suboptimal for capturing the nonstationary dynamics of the recorded signals. The general, automated technique of mu EvId, together with existing models that can identify broad behavioural categories, provides future studies with a powerful toolkit to exploit the full potential of accelerometers for animal behaviour recognition.",2020,10.1111/2041-210X.13491,yes,accelerometer_audio video,obs,Suricatta_suricatta,carnivore,mammal,"axy, direct_video",10,n/a,0.125,,0.125,AB,yes,ethogram,"axy, validation, ground_truthing",methodolgy/validation paper more than actual research,

It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at ). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.",2020,10.1111/1365-2656.13105,yes,accelerometer,obs,Equus_quagga,ungulate,mammal,GPS,1,n/a,,180,1,B,yes,resting,behavioural_state,,KEY

Objectives We described Eleonora's falcon phenology and habitat use based on fine-scale telemetry data and field surveys, and investigated which environmental parameters shape the observed patterns, to obtain a better insight into the species' ecological requirements during the wintering season. Methods We used high resolution GPS telemetry and remotely sensed data to establish bird-habitat associations and investigate spatiotemporal activity. We also verified habitat composition through ground surveys. Results Eleonora's falcon exploits a variety of habitats, exhibiting a distinct phenological pattern in their use. The species exhibits high site fidelity, moving progressively from more open areas towards landscapes with denser tree cover, possibly as a response to spatiotemporal patterns in food abundance. Time budget analysis revealed that Eleonora's falcon dedicates just about 15% of its daily activity to foraging, which is performed almost exclusively during daylight hours, with a greater tendency to forage at higher elevations with denser tree cover. On-site assessment of habitat composition revealed that existing habitat maps overlook small fragments of habitat and land use. However, the species' overall preference for humid forest suggests ongoing deforestation would adversely affect the availability of preferred habitat.

Three-dimensional accelerometer data, in particular, can provide extremely detailed information on individuals' activity and energetics associated with critical life-history events, such as reproduction and mortality. Applications, where accelerometer data have been recorded over sufficiently long periods of time to quantify how individuals modulate their activities when facing seasonality, environmental constraints, and how this might affect life-history events, remain rare, however. We collected high-resolution accelerometer data, over an entire year, from seven muskox females (Ovibos moschatus) with different reproductive statuses moving in the high-Artic. Individual-specific hidden Markov models (HMMs) were built based on overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and pitch. Snow depth was included as a dependent structure to incorporate the dominant environmental constraint on muskox activity. We used GPS and vaginal implant transmitter data to further clarify the behavioral partition and to validate calving and mortality events. We detected lower ODBA recordings during periods with increased snow depth, suggesting that snow influences animal velocity and movement-related (energetic) costs. Time budgets and behavioral switching showed clear seasonal patterns, with distinct signatures depending on individuals' survival and reproductive status. Individuals that ultimately died drastically reduced time spent foraging/searching for food during winter, between February and May when snow depth is highest, while increasing time spent transiting/being highly active. This pattern could indicate failure to acquire sufficient food resources. Overall, individuals that survived the Arctic year spent greater amounts of time foraging yet with high individual variability in time spent foraging and transiting. Individuals that gave birth showed marked behavioral shifts at parturition times with a clear reduction in foraging behavior and increased activity. We show how long-term high-resolution accelerometer data analyzed within HMM frameworks can successfully be used to detect environmental-dependent behavioral changes with implications for life-history events. Such information opens up opportunities to study life-history events in more detail and will facilitate integration of data at both individual and population levels, which is critical for management and conservation of species.",2021,10.1002/ecs2.3565,yes,accelerometer_remote,obs,Ovibos_moschatus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, axy, HMM",5,n/a,365,8760,365,BC,yes,ethogram,"behavioural_state, accelerometer",no direct obs for ground truthing,

Within this, the specific availability of both terrestrial and aquatic resources is expected to impact individual fitness. Beavers are highly dependent on water for movement and protection from predators. They are central place foragers and mostly forage on woody vegetation near water although aquatic vegetation may also be an important food resource. However, little is known about their use of aquatic habitats. We aimed to address this knowledge gap by dead-reckoning fine-scale movement tracks and classifying fine-scale diving events, which we then related to the spatial distribution of aquatic vegetation and habitat components within the territory. Results Overall, there was a statistically clear decrease in probability that diving would occur at dawn and with increasing distance from territory borders. In addition, the distance from the lodge at which animals dived decreased through the night and during the spring/early summer. There was strong selection for diving habitats located closer to the riverbank, with stronger selection for these areas being observed in individuals with larger home ranges. We saw a higher selection for diving above clay sediment, and within 150 m from the lodge, presumably because mud and clay sediment tended to be located closer to the lodge than sand and rock sediment. Furthermore, we found a clear selection for diving in the presence of quillwort (Isoetes spp.), shoreweed (Littorella uniflora), and stonewort (Nitella spp.). Selection for these focal species was stronger among subordinate individuals. Individuals with lower body condition dived closer to the beaver lodge, and dives located further from the lodge were associated with high densities of aquatic vegetation. Conclusion We provide new knowledge on the aquatic habitat use in a semi-aquatic mammal and show how energetic constraints may shape how beavers spatially use the aquatic environment, whereby short and shallow dives appear most beneficial.

It is also fundamental to assessing potential transmission risks of zoonotic pathogens in human-wildlife interfaces. We evaluated the influence of environmental and behavioral variables on the foraging patterns of Pteropus lylei (a reservoir of Nipah virus) in a heterogeneous landscape in Cambodia. Methods We employed an approach based on animal-movement modeling, which comprised a path-segmentation method (hidden Markov model) to identify individual foraging-behavior sequences in GPS data generated by eight P. lylei. We characterized foraging localities, foraging activity, and probability of returning to a given foraging locality over consecutive nights. Generalized linear mixed models were also applied to assess the influence of several variables including proxies for energetic costs and quality of foraging areas. Results Bats performed few foraging bouts (area-restricted searches) during a given night, mainly in residential areas, and the duration of these decreased during the night. The probability of a bat revisiting a given foraging area within 48 h varied according to the duration previously spent there, its distance to the roost site, and the corresponding habitat type. We interpret these fine-scale patterns in relation to global habitat quality (including food-resource quality and predictability), habitat-familiarity and experience of each individual. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that heterogeneous human-made environments may promote complex patterns of foraging-behavior and short-term re-visitation in fruit bat species that occur in such landscapes.

Of the 245 locations where the dogs were recorded 95% were within native vegetation (savannah and forest), even though these habitats comprised only 34% of the pack's home range. This indicates a preference for native vegetation, and this was reinforced by composition analysis of habitat use, which showed that the pack used savannah and forest more than expected and cultivated areas less than expected. Analysis of activity showed that the bush dogs were moving quickly in more than half of the locations in cultivated areas, foraging in most savannah locations and resting in most forest locations.

New techniques for inferring behavioral states and their relation to social and environmental factors provide a powerful way to test the influence of such factors on individuals. One such technique that has recently gained popularity is the use of hidden Markov models, which link time series of movement variables and the underlying behavioral states of individuals. We used hidden Markov models to evaluate behavioral states and their relation to environmental, seasonal, and social factors in the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) while accounting for individual heterogeneity with discrete random effects. We identified 2 distinct behavioral states, resting and foraging, which were related to covariates in our models. Using this approach, we concluded that woodpecker step lengths tended to be longest in winter, larger groups of woodpeckers tended to spend less time foraging and more time resting when compared with smaller groups, and woodpeckers foraged more and rested less when in higher-quality habitat. Our results demonstrate the impact that social and environmental factors can have on movement in a social species and, thus, reinforce the importance of including these factors in animal movement studies.

In this study, we analysed the movement tracks of nine radio-collared wolves during their pup-rearing season. The wolves lived in the boreal zone in Finland. Our interest was in analysing the foraging trips of wolves from the den site, which serves as the central place of the pack in summer. Based on the information on spatial relocations and time of the day, the movement tracks of the collared wolves were split into segments using hidden Markov models (HMM). Those segments were considered to be produced by different movement behaviour modes that were not observed. We first split the movement tracks of the wolves into separate foraging trips using a two-state HMM and further extracted the different movement modes with a four-state HMM. The modes were interpreted as rest, moderate activity, homing to the den site and fast movement for other purposes, such as leaving the den. Our analysis showed that, for most of the individuals, the movement during homing was fastest and most persistent. This research highlights the foraging behaviour of wolves during the pup-rearing season, which has gained less attention than the nomadic behaviour outside of this season.

Although this has been extensively studied in small mammals, the influence of predation and prey acquisition on the activity and behavior of large carnivores has received little attention. The diurnal activity described as typical for cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) has been explained in terms of their avoidance of antagonistic interactions with other larger predators. However, a recent study revealed that cheetahs are frequently active at night, especially during periods of full moon. Being both predator and prey in an environment with comparatively high densities of larger and competitively dominant nocturnal predator species, we investigated whether cheetah nocturnal behavior could be explained by favorable conditions for 1) predator avoidance or 2) prey acquisition. We used a data set of continuously recorded behavior created using machine-learning techniques on behavioral data collected in the field to transform recorded 2D activity values from radio-collars into 3 distinct behavioral states (feeding, moving, and resting). We found that 32.5% of cheetah feeding behavior occurred at night and that, in the dry season, nocturnal feeding behavior was positively correlated with moonlight intensity. Our results suggest that nocturnal and circalunar behavior of cheetahs is driven by optimal hunting conditions, outweighing the risks of encountering other predators.

The ability of wild animals to adapt to environmental changes has important consequences for their fitness, survival, and reproduction. Behavioural flexibility, an immediate adjustment of behaviour in response to environmental variability, may be particularly important for coping with anthropogenic change. The main aim of this study was to quantify the response of two wintering goose species (bean goose Anser fabalis and lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus) to poor habitat condition at population level by studying foraging behaviour. In addition, we tested whether behavioural plasticity could alter trophic niche. We characterised foraging behaviours and calculated daily home range (HR) of the geese using global positioning system tracking data. We calculated standard ellipse areas to quantify niche width using the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of individual geese. We linked behavioural plasticity with habitat quality using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) models. We also tested the correlation between standard ellipse areas and HR using ANCOVA model. We found significant differences in geese foraging behaviours between years in their daily foraging area, travel distance and speed, and turning angle. Specifically, the birds increased their foraging area to satisfy their daily energy intake requirement in response to poor habitat conditions. They flew more sinuously and travelled faster and longer distances on a daily basis. For the endangered lesser white-fronted goose, all behaviour variables were associated with habitat quality. For bean goose, only HR and turning angle were correlated with habitat quality. The birds, especially the lesser white-fronted goose, may have had a higher trophic position under poor conditions. Our findings indicate that wintering geese showed a high degree of behavioural plasticity. However, more active foraging behaviours under poor habitat condition did not lead to a broader trophic niche. Habitat availability could be responsible to the divergent responses of foraging HR and isotopic niche to human-induced environmental change. Therefore, maintaining natural hydrological regimes during the critical period (i.e. September-November) to ensure that quality food resources are available is central to the future of populations of geese within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.",2019,10.1111/fwb.13294,yes,remote,obs,"Anser_fabalis, Anser_erythropus",waterfowl,bird,"GPS, axy",78,840,,160,20,BC,yes,movement,"behavioural_state, movement","used step + turn angle to get foraging behaviour, also measured isotopes to get diet",

The gray brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) is widely distributed in the Neotropic region. In the Brazilian Pantanal wetland, gray brocket deer inhabit a unique landscape with varying ecotypes arranged in a mosaic, where seasonal flooding alters resource availability for the deer. Documenting animal activity and movement can be the key to understanding how a species interacts with its dynamic environment. We used data from accelerometers and characteristics of movement on six GPS-monitored gray brocket deer in the Pantanal wetland to investigate how habitat type, periods of the day, and cycles of flooding and drought affect activity, movement behavior, and displacement. Deer exhibited the lowest activity and encamped movement in closed habitat during diurnal and nocturnal periods, suggesting resting and foraging behaviors. The highest activity and exploratory movement occurred in open habitats, and potentially was related to deer searching for locations with greater resource availability. Individuals were displaced the most during floods, which was a response to access feeding sites that were free of water.

Yet, limited sample sizes and variation in space and habitat use across regions and life stages may compromise robustness of behavioral analyses and subsequent conservation plans. Here, we assessed variation in (i) home range sizes, (ii) home range selection, and (iii) fine-scale resource selection of white storks across breeding status and regions and test model transferability. Three study areas were chosen within the Central German breeding grounds ranging from agricultural to fluvial and marshland. We monitored GPS-locations of 62 adult white storks equipped with solar-charged GPS/3D-acceleration (ACC) transmitters in 2013-2014. Home range sizes were estimated using minimum convex polygons. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess home range selection and fine-scale resource selection by relating the home ranges and foraging sites to Corine habitat variables and normalized difference vegetation index in a presence/pseudo-absence design. We found strong variation in home range sizes across breeding stages with significantly larger home ranges in non-breeding compared to breeding white storks, but no variation between regions. Home range selection models had high explanatory power and well predicted overall density of Central German white stork breeding pairs. Also, they showed good transferability across regions and breeding status although variable importance varied considerably. Fine-scale resource selection models showed low explanatory power. Resource preferences differed both across breeding status and across regions, and model transferability was poor. Our results indicate that habitat selection of wild animals may vary considerably within and between populations, and is highly scale dependent. Thereby, home range scale analyses show higher robustness whereas fine-scale resource selection is not easily predictable and not transferable across life stages and regions. Such variation may compromise management decisions when based on data of limited sample size or limited regional coverage. We thus recommend home range scale analyses and sampling designs that cover diverse regional landscapes and ensure robust estimates of habitat suitability to conserve wild animal populations.",2018,10.3389/fevo.2018.00079,yes,accelerometer_remote,obs,Ciconia_ciconia,heron,bird,"GPS, axy",41,386,,8640,30,BC,yes,nest_attendance,"behavioural_state, movement, habitat_selection",axys ground truthed with obs of visible storks,

The tidal cycle was the major determinant of the time budget and some foraging trips were more distant from the colony than previously known (up to 26km away and lasting up to 45h). The longest trips were mostly made by off-duty parents, but on-duty parents also frequently left the nest unattended while foraging for 1-7h. However, the time spent at the colony area (47%) and the time spent roosting on the foraging grounds (16%) would have allowed almost continuous incubation, as in other species with shared incubation. Therefore, the low incubation attentiveness is not explained by the need for long foraging trips but is largely dependent on a high intermittent rhythm of incubation with many short recesses (5.8 +/- 2.6recesses/h) that were not spent foraging but just outside the burrow or thermoregulating at the seashore. As a result, the eggs were warmed on average only 1.7 degrees C above burrow temperature, slightly more during high tide periods and when burrow temperature was lower between 20:00 and 10:00h, only partly counteracting the temperature fluctuations of the incubation chamber. These results suggest that low incubation attentiveness is due to the favourable thermal conditions provided by safe nesting burrows and by the hot tropical breeding season, a combination that allows simultaneous foraging by parents and the exploitation of distant foraging grounds. Why Crab Plovers engage in many short recesses from incubation still remains to be clarified but the need to thermoregulate at the seashore and to watch for predators may play a role.",2015,10.1111/ibi.12208,yes,audio video_remote_logger,obs,Dromas_ardeola,shorebird,bird,"GPS, camera_trap, temperature_logger",13,,4.935897436,6238.461538,90,BC,yes,nest_attendance,"behavioural_state, nest_provisioning",three parallel approaches to look at nest attendance,

However, the relative importance in determining where and what herbivores forage still remains unclear, especially for small- and intermediate-sized herbivores. Our objective was to test the relative importance of predator and competitor activity, and forage quality and quantity on the proportion of time spent in a vegetation type and the proportion of time spent foraging by the intermediate-sized herbivore European hare (Lepus europaeus). We studied red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a predator species and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as a competitor. We investigated the time spent at a location and foraging time of hare using GPS with accelerometers. Forage quality and quantity were analyzed based on hand-plucked samples of a selection of the locally most important plant species in the diet of hare. Predator activity and competitor activity were investigated using a network of camera traps. Hares spent a higher proportion of time in vegetation types that contained a higher percentage of fibers (i.e., NDF). Besides, hares spent a higher proportion of time in vegetation types that contained relatively low food quantity and quality of forage (i.e., high percentage of fibers) during days that foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were more active. Also during days that rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were more active, hares spent a higher proportion of time foraging in vegetation types that contained a relatively low quality of forage. Although predation risk affected space use and foraging behavior, and competition affected foraging behavior, our study shows that food quality and quantity more strongly affected space use and foraging behavior than predation risk or competition.

Hance; Gehrt, Stanley D.",Behavioral responses by an apex predator to urbanization,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Wildlife can respond to urbanization positively (synanthropic) or negatively (misanthropic), and for some species, this is a nonlinear process, whereby low levels of urbanization elicit a positive response, but this response becomes negative at high levels of urbanization. We applied concepts from foraging theory to predict positive and negative behavioral responses of coyotes (Canis latrans) along an urbanization gradient in the Chicago metropolitan area, USA. We estimated home range size and complexity, and metrics of 3 movement behaviors (encamped, foraging, and traveling) using Hidden Markov movement models. We found coyotes exhibited negative behavioral responses to highly urbanized landscapes: coyotes viewed the landscape as lower quality, riskier, and more fragmented (home range size and complexity, and time spent encamped increased). Conversely, we found evidence of both positive and negative responses to suburban landscapes: coyotes not only viewed the landscape as higher quality than natural fragments and equally risky, but also viewed it as fragmented (home range size decreased, time spent encamped did not change, and home range complexity increased). Although the spatial and behavioral responses of coyotes to urbanization became increasingly negative as urbanization increased, coyotes were still able to occupy highly urbanized landscapes. Our study demonstrates how wildlife behavioral responses can be dependent on the degree of urbanization and represents one of the first descriptions of apex predator space use and movement in a highly urbanized landscape. As urbanization increases globally, wildlife must respond. We applied concepts from foraging behavior to determine how coyote movement behavior varies across a gradient of urbanization. In suburban landscapes, coyotes responded positively by requiring less space to live. In highly urbanized landscapes, coyotes responded negatively by requiring more space and spending more time not moving.

Of equal importance is the understanding of what landscape factors allow these movements to occur. We used the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), an urban apex predator in Melbourne, Australia, as a case study to understand their movement ecology in urban environments. Owl movement was recorded using automated GPS logging devices deployed on ten powerful owls, resulting in 10870 GPS locations. In combination with these positions, four environmental covariates, and a priori understanding of owl ecology were used to assign movements to three different states (prey handling/eating, foraging and transitory) based on step length and turning angles between sequential locations in a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the environmental covariate combination of time of night, Euclidean distance to riparian vegetation, and NDVI best described movement states. Owl movement states changed across the night. Shorter movements with many turns were made towards the beginning of the night in riparian areas with high NDVI. This behavior is most likely linked to prey handling, suggesting powerful owls are more likely to hunt early in the evenings and as such travel short distances while carrying large prey items. Transitory movements with limited changes in turning angles were the dominant movement state towards the end of the night. As owls leave areas of high NDVI, they quickly travel long distances across cleared land and impervious surfaces to connect to the next habitat patch where they then transition back into shorter step lengths where NDVI is higher. This research highlights the critical importance of riparian vegetation and high NDVI areas in driving powerful owl movement and foraging in urban landscapes. Conservation priority should be placed on retaining and restoring riparian corridors as areas not only for powerful owls and their prey, but also for many other species that utilize similar resources.

In dimorphic species, females are usually more selective in food choice, show greater bite rates and spend more time foraging than males. We evaluated sexual differences in foraging behaviour in Apennine chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, during the warm season, before the rut. Both sexes selected nutritious vegetation patches and spent a comparable amount of time feeding. However, males had a significantly greater feeding intensity (bite rate) and a lower search effort for feeding (step rate), as well as they spent more time lying down than females. Females selected foraging sites closer to refuge areas than males. In chamois, sexual size dimorphism is seasonal, being negligible in winter-spring, but increasing to 30-40 % in autumn. Our results suggest that males enhance their energy and mass gain by increasing their food intake rate during the warm season, to face the costs of the mating season (November). Conversely, females seem to prioritize a fine-scale selection of vegetation and the protection of offspring.

We investigated whether Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra (Linnaeus, 1758)) in a protected area in the Swiss Alps adapted their foraging behaviour to forage availability and quality by modeling the bite and step rates of individuals on vegetation nitrogen content, relative plant cover, sex, daytime, air temperature, and slope. Vegetation characteristics were derived using remote sensing data from airborne imaging spectroscopy data sets and feeding locations determined using a theodolite. Chamois increased their bite rates with decreasing forage nitrogen content, decreasing slope, and increasing temperature. Step rates were higher at high temperatures and decreased with increasing relative plant cover. Males showed higher bite rates and lower step rates than females. Daytime had no influence on either bite or step rates.

Since body mass could also influence the animal's sensitivity to predation risk, its vigilance behaviour should consequently be affected. Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) is characterised by a strong dimorphism among males of different ages, thus representing an ideal case study for testing the Jarman-Bell principle, avoiding possibly misleading effects resulting from the comparison between different species or genders. We analysed the fine-scale foraging behaviour of male ibex in order to assess the effect of body mass and the effects of vegetation quality/quantity on both foraging and vigilance behaviour. Our results showed that smaller males were more selective than larger ones, on account of their lower capability of digesting plant. Smaller males scanned the environment more frequently than larger ones. Male ibex grazed more selectively in sites with high quality forage and their bite rate increased as forage biomass decreased. Vigilance frequency increased with increasing forage biomass as, under these circumstances, ibex are able to prolong anti-predator vigilance while chewing bites that have already been cropped. Our findings highlight the effects of body mass per se on both foraging and anti-predator behaviours in herbivores, thus supporting the Jarman-Bell principle.

Different age and sex classes often show differences in foraging due to experience, skills or life history strategy, but such differences in hoarding under spatio-temporally varying environmental conditions have rarely been studied in the wild. We studied hoarding behaviour of Eurasian pygmy owls (Glaucidium passerinum) during 2003-2016 in western Finland, where the abundance of their main prey (voles) fluctuates in three-year population cycles. In 14years, 1056 food stores were found during the hoarding season (Oct-Dec) and 330 pygmy owls were trapped at these stores. The number of stores per individual did not vary in relation to age, sex or vole abundance. Adults (+1-year old) had their stores farther apart than yearlings. Both the number of stores per year and the biomass of stored prey items increased with vole abundance. Females and yearlings had larger and heavier stores than males and adults, respectively. The same individuals stored more food as yearlings than as adults. These sex- and age-differences in hoarding indicate that it is not constrained by experience or skills. It rather seems that less-experienced yearlings rely more on stored food than adults. Females may need more food due to their larger size and need to accumulate energy reserves before reproduction. A detailed knowledge of age- and sex-related differences in hoarding behaviour under fluctuating abundances of main foods is fundamental to better understand a population response to climate change and forest management.Significance statementThe hoarding behaviour of animals has evolved to cope with the problem of food limitation. On the basis of 14-year data from pygmy owls, we show that the number of stores per year and the biomass of prey items per store increased with vole abundance in the environment. Adults had stores farther apart than yearlings, and females and yearlings stored more prey items and biomass compared to males and adults, respectively. These results indicate that hoarding behaviour responds to the available main prey abundance and varies with traits such as age and sex.

In some species, such competition arises through kleptoparasitism, that is when an animal takes food which was caught or collected by a member of its social group. Except in the context of caching, few studies have investigated how individuals avoid kleptoparasitism, which could be based on physical strength/dominance but also cognitive skills. Here, we investigated the foraging success of wild common ravens, Corvus corax, experiencing high levels of kleptoparasitism from conspecifics when snatching food from the daily feedings of captive wild boars in a game park in the Austrian Alps. Success in keeping the food depended mainly on the individuals' age class and was positively correlated with the time to make a decision in whether to fly off with food or consume it on site. While the effect of age class suggests that dominant and/or experienced individuals are better in avoiding kleptoparasitism, the effect of decision time indicates that individuals benefit from applying cognition to such decision-making, independently of age class.

In bird species, nonbreeders often move through large areas whereby periods of long-term settlement can alternate with short-term visits. In food-caching species these differences in the degree of local settlement might change the benefits gained from storing food, and caching may only be advantageous during periods of prolonged settlement. We examined whether differences in local settlement influence food-caching behaviour of wild common ravens at a local anthropogenic food source with high interspecific and intraspecific competition. We found that individuals with a higher degree of site fidelity (i.e. prolonged periods of local settlement) engaged in food caching more than individuals with less site fidelity (i.e. short periods of local settlement); this effect was even stronger in the presence of potential predators representing a high-risk foraging situation. Further, juvenile ravens were less likely to cache than subadults and adults, and an increasing number of conspecifics present at the feeding site decreased the likelihood of caching. We found considerable individual variation in respect to the area used for caching. We suggest that individuals with higher site fidelity may gain more benefits from caching food and/or that they are more successful in obtaining food potentially due to more experience with the local foraging situation. Research is needed to examine the exact causes of the observed link between food-caching behaviour and the different degrees of site fidelity. Our findings show that differences in movement and settlement decisions can influence ecological aspects such as food acquisition and thus may have important consequences for individual fitness and population dynamics.

We established that cache pilferage risk decreased with distance from cover and was thus negatively correlated with long-term predation risk. We then measured changes in foraging and food-caching behavior in the face of changes in the risk of predation and food theft over a short time-scale. We found that, overall, squirrels move further away from the safety of cover when they cache, compared to when they forage, as predicted by pilferage risk. However, there was no effect of immediate pilferage or predation risk (i.e., the presence of potential predators or pilferers) on the distance from cover at which they cached, and only a slight increase in forage distance when predation risk increased.

We collected 1,241 videos taken at all times of the day and night from 15 camera collars and confirmed consumption of 40 plant species with an 84% probability of identification. Diets of individual deer varied considerably, though there was an apparent preference for prickly-pear cactus (Opuntia engelmannii) and blackbrush acacia (Vachellia rigidula).

Because synchronized vigilance deviates from the classical vigilance models, which assume independent scanning, it is important to understand when and why it occurs. We explored vigilance behavior of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in a population subject to spatial variation in human hunting risk and seasonal variation in food availability. Group members synchronized their vigilance behavior. We hypothesized that vigilance synchronization would be context dependent and the trade-off between energy gain and safety would shape the relationship between the degree of vigilance synchronization and group size. We predicted weaker synchronization in large groups under heavy predation risk, due to benefits of numerical dilution, and stronger synchronization in large groups when food is limiting, due to intense food competition. The degree of synchronization decreased with increasing group size in the area where human hunting added another risk factor to the natural predation, pointing at the safety benefits of vigilance synchrony for members of small groups and the role of human-induced risk in shaping vigilance synchrony. We found no relation between vigilance synchrony and group size in a food scarce, winter season. However, low levels of vigilance and its synchronization observed in winter indicated that energy gain was prioritized over safety. Thus, members of wild boar groups can adjust levels of vigilance and its synchronization depending on the forage-risk trade-off set by the ecological context.",2016,10.1093/beheco/arw016,yes,ethology,obs,Sus_scrofa,ungulate,mammal,camera_trap,89,0.010496846,0.001134259,,730,AB,no,vigilance,"camera_trap, social, synchrony","cameras were up for two years, n = number of detections & obs.time = average length of said detection",

Broad-scale land conversions and fertilizer use have dramatically altered the available staging area for herbivorous long-distance migrants. Instead of natural land, these birds rely increasingly on pastures for migratory fuelling and stopover, often conflicting with farming practices. To predict and manage birds' future habitat use, the relative advantages and disadvantages of natural (e.g. saltmarsh, intertidal) versus anthropogenic staging sites for foraging need to be understood. 2. We compared the migratory staging of brent geese on saltmarsh and pasture sites in spring. Food quality (nitrogen and fibre content), antagonistic behaviour, and body weight were quantified at nearby sites in simultaneous seasons. Individuals were tracked with high-resolution GPS and accelerometers to compare timing of migration and time budgets during fuelling. 3. On pastures, birds rested more and experienced higher ingestion rates, similar or superior food quality and reduced antagonistic interactions than on saltmarsh. 4. Brent geese using fertilized grasslands advanced their fuelling and migration schedules compared to those using saltmarsh. Pasture birds reached heavy weights earlier, departed sooner, and arrived in the Arctic earlier. 5. Intertidal mudflats were frequently visited by saltmarsh birds during the day, and available food there (algae, some seagrass) was of higher quality than terrestrial resources. Availability of intertidal resources was an important factor balancing the otherwise more favourable conditions on pastures relative to saltmarsh. 6. Synthesis and applications. Disadvantages of longer foraging effort, more antagonistic interactions and delayed fuelling schedules on traditional saltmarshes may cause geese to exchange this traditional niche in favour of pastures, especially in a warming climate that requires advancement of migratory schedules. However, due to its high quality, intertidal forage can complement terrestrial foraging, potentially removing the incentive for habitat switches to pastures. The relatively high quality of green algae and seagrass, and birds' remarkable preference for these resources when available, provides a key for managers to create landscapes that can sustain this specialist's intertidal lifestyle. To keep natural habitats attractive to staging geese with the purpose of preventing conflicts with farming practices, management actions should focus on conservation and restoration of saltmarsh and especially intertidal habitat.",2018,10.1111/1365-2664.13168,yes,accelerometer_remote,obs,Branta_bernicla,waterfowl,bird,"GPS, axy",30,14,,2160,90,ABC,yes,ethogram,captive_video_calibration,filmed 4 geese in captivity to validate axy signatures for rest-forage-fly,

However, being able to utilize these multiple meals requires that they can cache the meat in a manner that delays its discovery by vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers. Covering the kill with vegetation and snow is a commonly observed strategy among felids. This study investigates the utility of this strategy using observational data from Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)-killed roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) carcasses, and a set of two experiments focused on vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers, respectively. Lynx-killed roe deer that were covered by snow or vegetation were less likely to have been visited by scavengers. Experimentally-deployed video-monitored roe deer carcasses had significantly longer time prior to discovery by avian scavengers when covered with vegetation. Carcass parts placed in cages that excluded vertebrate scavengers had delayed invertebrate activity when covered with vegetation. All three datasets indicated that covering a kill was a successful caching/anti-scavenger strategy.

Four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the ultimate determinants for cathemeral activity in lemurs: thermoregulatory benefits, anti-predator strategy, competition avoidance and metabolic dietary-related needs. However, these have only been explored in the frugivorous genus Eulemur, with some species increasing nocturnality as a possible response to avoid diurnal raptors and to increase their ability to digest fibre during resource-scarce periods. Since Eulemur lack specializations for digesting bulk food, this strategy would allow for processing fibres over the full 24-h. The folivorous lemurids, i.e. genus Hapalemur, provide a divergent model to explore these hypotheses due to gastrointestinal adaptations for digesting dietary fibre and small body size compared to Eulemur. We linked continuous activity data collected from archival tags with observational behaviour and feeding data from three groups of adult Hapalemur meridionalis from January to December 2013. We tested the effects of thermoregulation, predator avoidance and the weighted proportion of digestible dietary fibre on the daily diurnal/nocturnal activity ratio using a Linear Mixed-Model. Our best-fit model revealed that increased canopy exposure and dietary fibre predicted greater diurnality. Our findings partly contrast with previous predictions for frugivorous lemurids. We propose a divergent adaptive explanation for folivorous lemurids. We suggest that the need to avoid terrestrial predators, as well as longer digestive bouts during bulk food periods, may override cathemerality in favour of diurnality in these bamboo lemurs. Significance statement Southern bamboo lemurs are active throughout the 24-h day, with high proportions of dietary fibre increasing diurnality, in contrast to other cathemeral primates. They also increase diurnality on days when using areas with greater canopy exposure, potentially avoiding nocturnal predators in risky foraging areas. We suggest that folivorous lemurids may require long periods of inactivity to conserve energy and digest dietary fibre, thus limiting activity to periods of optimal foraging efficiency over the 24-h cycle.",2017,10.1007/s00265-016-2247-3,yes,ethology_biologger,obs,Hapalemur_meridionalis,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, all_day_follow, activity_logger",10,2.3,5.02625,,365,AB,yes,ethogram,"circadian, social, focal_sampling",,

The African oryx (Oryx gazella), a large ungulate native to the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa, was intentionally released into the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico to provide increased hunting opportunities. Oryx have subsequently dispersed widely, including into the adjacent Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research site, which contains native grassland communities imperiled due to shrub encroachment. We examined how landscape use and diel activity of oryx interacts with shrub encroachment at Jornada Basin. We hypothesized that oryx would be more common on unencroached grasslands that provide preferred forage, and that oryx would be most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular) when ambient temperatures were favorable and predator surveillance was possible. We sampled 24 sites across a broad gradient of shrub encroachment from 2014 to 2018 using camera traps to evaluate our hypotheses. Oryx relative abundances were higher on unencroached grasslands, especially in years of low to moderate precipitation. We found oryx were most active during crepuscular periods, and this behavior was consistent across the shrub encroachment gradient.

We used GPS data to investigate the temporal patterns of wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) foraging on large prey in northern Alberta. We built a predictive model of wolverine large-prey events (beaver predation or ungulate scavenging) based on the spatial and temporal patterns of wolverine GPS data at foraging sites we visited in the field in winter. We used this model to predict large-prey events throughout our entire wolverine GPS dataset in winter and summer. We then evaluated how variables related to prey availability, seasonality, competition, and territoriality affected wolverine encounter time, residency time, and return time at predicted large-prey events. We found that wolverines encountered large prey more often in the spring when there is increased beaver and ungulate availability. The total time that wolverines spent at large-prey events was greater in winter (3.11 days [95th percentile = 2.62-3.63 days]) than summer (2.08 days [95th percentile = 1.70-2.51 days]), potentially because prey availability is limited in winter or prey is easier to capture in summer. Wolverines partitioned the total time at events into multiple visits, reducing their residency time and increasing their return time with each revisit, indicating biomass decline through time. The time between visits in winter (10.12 days [95th percentile = 7.99-12.56 days]) and summer (8.39 days [95th percentile = 7.18-9.74 days]) suggests wolverines might be patrolling their home range. We also found that wolverine residency time decreased and return time increased when there were other large-prey events available. Moreover, wolverine residency time at events increased when other wolverines were in the area.

B.; Macdonald, David W.",Understanding decision making in a food-caching predator using hidden Markov models,MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,"Background Tackling behavioural questions often requires identifying points in space and time where animals make decisions and linking these to environmental variables. State-space modeling is useful for analysing movement trajectories, particularly with hidden Markov models (HMM). Yet importantly, the ontogeny of underlying (unobservable) behavioural states revealed by the HMMs has rarely been verified in the field. Methods Using hidden Markov models of individual movement from animal location, biotelemetry, and environmental data, we explored multistate behaviour and the effect of associated intrinsic and extrinsic drivers across life stages. We also decomposed the activity budgets of different movement states at two general and caching phases. The latter - defined as the period following a kill which likely involves the caching of uneaten prey - was subsequently confirmed by field inspections. We applied this method to GPS relocation data of a caching predator, Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor in northeastern Iran. Results Multistate modeling provided strong evidence for an effect of life stage on the behavioural states and their associated time budget. Although environmental covariates (ambient temperature and diel period) and ecological outcomes (predation) affected behavioural states in non-resident leopards, the response in resident leopards was not clear, except that temporal patterns were consistent with a crepuscular and nocturnal movement pattern. Resident leopards adopt an energetically more costly mobile behaviour for most of their time while non-residents shift their behavioural states from high energetic expenditure states to energetically less costly encamped behaviour for most of their time, which is likely to be a risk avoidance strategy against conspecifics or humans. Conclusions This study demonstrates that plasticity in predator behaviour depending on life stage may tackle a trade-off between successful predation and avoiding the risks associated with conspecifics, human presence and maintaining home range. Range residency in territorial predators is energetically demanding and can outweigh the predator's response to intrinsic and extrinsic variables such as thermoregulation or foraging needs.

Recently, models have been developed to explore these mechanisms for both territorial and non-territorial species. One such model for a generic forager suggests animal memory and optimal foraging theory as underlying mechanisms driving forager movement and the development of stable home ranges. Although this is a promising model for ungulate home range development, assumptions of the model have yet to be evaluated. Using GPS relocation data from two populations of elk, we explored how foraging patch selection might influence the structure and development of home ranges in elk Cervus elaphus. During the summer growing season, we identified and sampled foraging patches used by elk. Points along elk paths not used for foraging were sampled identically for comparison. We contrasted 'patch' and 'nonpatch' data points, to identify foraging selection differences across herd, sex and season using a combination of directly sampled and remotely sensed covariates. In general, elk selected patches with higher biomass, cover, slope and lower traffic on the nearest road. These patch-selection results speak directly to differences between foraging areas and other areas used by elk and demonstrate that both physiographic and anthropocentric features influence foraging patch selection.

Although these approaches might apply well to grazing in patchy landscapes, species that either feed for short periods on large, concentrated food sources or cache food exhibit movements that are difficult to model using the traditional metrics of turn-angle and step-length alone. Results: We used GPS telemetry collected from a prey-caching predator, the cougar (Puma concolor, Linnaeus), to test whether combining metrics of site recursion, spatiotemporal clustering, speed, and turning into an index of movement using partial sums, improves the ability to identify caching behavior. The index was used to identify changes in movement characteristics over time and segment paths into behavioral classes. The identification of behaviors from the Path Identification Index (PII) was evaluated using field investigations of cougar activities at GPS locations. We tested for statistical stationarity across behaviors for use of topographic view-sheds. Changes in the frequency and duration of PII were useful for identifying seasonal activities such as migration, gestation, and denning. The comparison of field investigations of cougar activities to behavioral PII classes resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 81%. Conclusions: Changes in behaviors were reflected in cougars' use of topographic view-sheds, resulting in statistical nonstationarity over time, and revealed important aspects of hunting behavior.

The main objective of this study was to identify the relative importance of mammals in the dispersal and predation of Mauritia flexuosa palm fruits. We installed camera-traps in front of palm fallen seeds and clusters with fruits. A catalog of species was prepared with the recorded videos and the foraging behaviors exhibited were classified and identified. In addition, two exclusion treatments with three repetitions each were used. In the semi-open treatment, a plot was fenced with metal mesh leaving four openings in order to allow access only to small and medium sized mammals, while in the open treatment, the small, medium and large sized mammals had free access. In both cases, seed removal was evaluated. We recorded a total of 19 species of mammals, nine of which fed on palm fruits and the other five were seed dispersers. We reported for the first time the consumption of Mauritia flexuosa fruits by Atelocynus microtis. The species with the highest relative importance was Dasyprocta fuliginosa, which showed the highest percentage of seed dispersal (63.5%) compared to the other species. Tayassu peccary was identified as an in situ consumer, eating 45.3% of seeds without dispersing them. The number of seeds consumed in situ in the open treatment showed significant differences regarding the semi-open treatment, suggesting greater involvement of large mammals in this process. In conclusion, the fruits of M. flexuosa are an important food source for the local mammal community. Additionally, the consumption of seeds under the canopy of the mother palm is proportionally greater than their dispersion. Generally, the pressure of frugivorous species over seeds may determine the reproductive strategies of plants.

We tested the hypothesis that scrub-jays reduce their attendance in response to seed crop size on Quercus lobata, the species preferentially attended by acorn woodpeckers, and therefore reduce the risk of potential injury from aggression when community-level seed production enables them to forage on other trees (the Baggression-avoidance<^> hypothesis). Results indicated that scrub-jay attendance correlated positively with Q. lobata crops during the year when community-level seed production was low, resulting in high levels of aggression. In contrast, during the 2 years when acorns of other species were abundant in the landscape, scrub-jays reduced attendance at Q. lobata and experienced less aggression. Similarly, we found that the scrub-jays experienced equally low rates of aggression at Q. douglasii trees that were attended by fewer acorn woodpeckers. These results support the aggression-avoidance hypothesis and illustrate how resource and social dynamics may interact to determine the attendance of mutualistic seed dispersers at oak species competing for seed dispersal.

Understanding where animals forage is important for the conservation of multi-species communities, since interspecific competition can emerge if different species use the same depletable resources. However, determining forage resources in a spatially continuous fashion in alpine grasslands at high spatial resolution was challenging up to now, because terrain heterogeneity causes vegetation characteristics to vary at small spatial scales, and methods for detection of behavioural phases in animal movement patterns were not widely available. We delineated areas coupled to the foraging behaviour of three sympatric ungulate species (chamois, ibex, red deer) using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH), a non-parametric utilisation distribution method incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation structure of GPS data. We used resource maps of plant biomass and plant nitrogen content derived from high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy data, and multinomial logistic regression to compare the foraging areas of the three ungulate species. Results: We found significant differences in plant biomass and plant nitrogen content between the core foraging areas of chamois, ibex and red deer. Core foraging areas of chamois were characterised by low plant biomass and low to medium plant nitrogen content. Core foraging areas of ibex were, in contrast, characterised by high plant nitrogen content, but varied in plant biomass, and core foraging areas of red deer had high plant biomass, but varied in plant nitrogen content. Conclusions: Previous studies carried out in the same study area found no difference in forage consumed by chamois, ibex and red deer. Methodologically, those studies were based on micro-histological analysis of plant fragments identifying them to plant family or functional type level. However, vegetation properties such as productivity (biomass) or plant nutrient content can vary within vegetation communities, especially in highly heterogeneous landscapes.

Here, we present the first experimental test of the effects of glucocorticoids on helper behavior in a cooperative breeder. Glucocorticoid levels of adult female and male meerkat, Suricata suricatta, helpers were elevated with an intramuscular injection of cortisol (hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate sodium salt) dissolved in saline, whereas matched controls simultaneously received an injection of physiological saline.

Despite significant research into crop-foraging by primates, relatively little is understood about the behavior and movements of primates in and around crop fields, largely due to the limitations of traditional observational methods. Crop-foraging by primates in large-scale agriculture has also received little attention. We used GPS and accelerometer bio-loggers, along with environmental data, to gain an understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of activity for a female in a crop-foraging baboon group in and around commercial farms in South Africa over one year. Crop fields were avoided for most of the year, suggesting that fields are perceived as a high-risk habitat. When field visits did occur, this was generally when plant primary productivity was low, suggesting that crops were a fallback food. All recorded field visits were at or before 15:00. Activity was significantly higher in crop fields than in the landscape in general, evidence that crop-foraging is an energetically costly strategy and that fields are perceived as a risky habitat. In contrast, activity was significantly lower within 100 m of the field edge than in the rest of the landscape, suggesting that baboons wait near the field edge to assess risks before crop-foraging. Together, this understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop-foraging can help to inform crop protection strategies and reduce conflict between humans and baboons in South Africa.",2021,10.1002/ece3.7114,yes,accelerometer_remote,obs,Papio_ursinus,primate,mammal,"GPS, axy",1,40.8,,5728,357,BC,yes,movement,"crop_raiding, behavioural_state, activity","two collars deployed, only one worked, so essentially natural history",

Using high-resolution GPS-tracking data, this study explored the fine-scale movement patterns and risk sensitivity of crop-raiding African elephants, Loxodonta africana, in the anthropogenic landscape of Tsavo, Kenya. We analysed patterns in the speed and tortuosity of elephant movements over the 24 h surrounding crop-raiding events and compared them with those of nonraiding elephants during corresponding periods. Crop-raiding elephants moved faster and straighter (less tortuously) with closer temporal proximity to farmland, which we argue reflects their increased intensity of risk avoidance behaviours in response to approaching humans. Once inside farmland, elephants appeared to reduce movements associated with risk avoidance to forage intensively on crops, decreasing their speed and reducing the likelihood of moving in straight lines while crop raiding. These results highlight trade-offs in the fine-scale movement patterns of elephants living in anthropogenic landscapes with differing levels of habitat quality and exposure to humans, providing new insight into how they perceive the risks associated with crop raiding.

Currently, mitigation strategies fail to target the individuals responsible for initiating and maintaining this behavior. As primates mainly forage on crops in groups, we investigate the crop-foraging behavior of a group of 40 chacma baboons in Zimbabwe from the perspective of collective movements, i.e., when a group of animals move together in the same direction, thus resulting in a change of location. We collected data on 110 crop-foraging events during 35 days in March-April 2014. We recorded baboon movement and behavior with a camcorder and obtained further information through video analysis. Most crop-foraging events involved less than 20% of the troop and lasted less than 3 min. Although crop-foraging parties were composed of all age-sex classes, adult females and particularly adult males initiated most crop-foraging events and made direct movements (without stopping on the road) more often than nonadult participants. Baboons made up to five successive attempts to crop forage in a single crop-foraging event. Neither the number of participants nor the success of the crop-foraging events increased over the successive attempts. Finally, crop-foraging events were more successful and more frequent in unguarded areas than in guarded areas. These results suggest that group members are highly synchronized and that crop-foraging is based on a collective decision such as classical foraging movements. In addition, the short duration of the crop-foraging events might prevent detection of baboons by farmers. The more frequent initiation of crop-foraging by adults compared to nonadults might be explained by greater energetic needs or a greater tendency of adults to take risks. These preliminary data can help inform long-term strategies for farmers to reduce crop losses to baboons, as guarding helps reduce damage but does not prevent it.",2017,10.1007/s10764-017-9958-9,yes,audio video,obs,Papio_hamadryas,primate,mammal,direct_video,1,16,8.75,,35,AB,no,ethogram,"crop_raiding, social",the group had 40 baboons but they just watched the group in its entirety,

We investigated whether such changes in prey types were innate and inflexible or whether they were based on the proximate cue of offspring size. We created experimental broods in which parent blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca received either older nestlings simulating rapid development or younger nestlings simulating delayed development. The size of prey increased over time in all brood types, suggesting a strong programmed pattern of foraging by parents. However, delayed broods were provisioned with smaller prey than control or advanced broods indicating some plasticity in the response by the parents to the size of nestlings. Although female birds brought smaller prey than male birds, both sexes showed the same rate of increase of prey size with time and brought similar types of prey items. The proportion of soft, digestible larva prey in the nestling diet decreased over time in pied flycatchers but increased in blue tits. Counter to the hypothesis that spiders provide unique and preferred nutrients for young nestlings, the proportion of arachnids in the diet did not change with nestling age for either species. The lack of treatment effect on the taxa of prey delivered suggests that temporal shifts in diet composition are not driven by the proximate cues of nestling age or size but that the feeding patterns are fairly innate and fixed in these altricial birds.",2014,10.1007/s00265-014-1684-0,yes,remote_video,exp,"Cyanistes_caeruleus, Ficedula_hypoleuca",passerine,bird,camera_trap,60,n/a,0.291666667,,7,B,no,nest_attendance,"cross_fostering, nest_provisioning","n = nests, parents not distinguished",

Here, we investigate the possibility that lateralized behaviors affect the structure of foraging flocks. Phalaropes (Scolopacidae: Phalaropus) are highly aquatic shorebirds and the only vertebrates that spin on the water to feed, often in large flocks. There is anecdotal evidence that individuals spin in a single direction and that those spinning counter the majority are usually found at the periphery of a flock. Although such phenotypic segregation may reduce interference among socially foraging birds, its extent and underlying mechanism remain unexplored. Using over 900 spinning bouts from freely available video repositories, we find support for individual, but not population, lateralization of spinning in the three phalarope species. Although spinning direction was not determined by the position occupied within a flock (periphery vs. core), nearest neighbors were more likely to spin in the same direction; moreover, they were three times less likely to interfere with each other when aligning spinning direction. Our results indicate that a simple rule (keep foraging with similarly lateralized individuals) can generate self-organized interactions among flockmates, resulting in groups phenotypically assorted.",2020,10.1093/beheco/araa101,yes,audio video_ethology,obs,Phalaropus_spp.,shorebird,bird,direct_video,909,198 points,0.000358796,,n/a,B,no,n/a,"crowdsource_video, social",collected videos online of phalaropes - timerange is meaningless,

We applied statistical analyses that have been used to study neural decision-making for gaze redirection in primates to 3 species of predatory birds with different sizes, visual systems, habitats, and hunting behaviors: the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Cooper's Hawk (A. cooperii), and Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). The timing of head saccades was measured during visual searches using field video recordings of foraging raptors, and during a variety of behaviors using a miniature camera mounted on the head of a Northern Goshawk. The resulting statistical distribution of latencies (time between successive head saccades) was compared to predictions from various models proposed to describe visual search strategies. Our results did not support models that assume a constant probability of gaze redirection per unit time, a constant time for giving up'' on the visual search, or an initial setup time before visual search initiation. Instead, our data were fit best by a lognormal distribution, consistent with the raptors stochastically changing their gaze direction on the basis of accumulated environmental information. Specifically, this suggests that saccade initiation arises from a neural computation based on detection of a threshold level of a dynamically updated decision signal that encodes noisy sensory data, similar to the processes inferred from previous studies of visual search strategies in primates. The only significant between-species difference we found was a slower mean gaze-redirection rate for 2 larger species compared to the Cooper's Hawk, even though the latter has hunting behavior and maneuverability similar to that of the Northern Goshawk.

Although their behaviour is little studied, armadillos provide valuable models for understanding how physiology affects mammalian behaviour in response to environmental changes. We used GPS devices to track yellow armadillos, Euphractus sexcinctus, and southern three-banded armadillos, Tolypeutes matacus, at three sites of the Pantanal wetlands, Brazil. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the variation in the timing and duration of activity patterns according to changes in air temperature. We fitted step selection functions to evaluate the effects of cover type, diel cycle and air temperature on armadillo habitat selection. Our models suggest that E. sexcinctus activity during the daytime decreases as air temperature increases. In contrast, T. matacus shows less variation, maintaining a predominantly nocturnal activity pattern. However, as air temperature decreases, activity periods of T. matacus are of shorter duration and peak earlier in the day. Both species should select forested areas when experiencing air temperatures outside their thermoneutral zones, as these areas act as thermal shelters. This study provides specific examples of the dynamic nature of activity patterns and habitat selection, and illustrates how thermal constraints, which vary dynamically over the daily cycle and among days, can alter behaviour. Our results highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity for the long-term conservation of animal species that rely on behaviour to achieve adequate thermoregulation.

We recorded the foraging behaviour of five adult female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, for continuous periods of 4-8 weeks, totalling 275 full days, throughout multiple fruiting seasons in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We found that chimpanzees fed on individual trees that were significantly larger than other available and reproductively mature trees of the same species, especially if their fruit emitted an obvious smell. Trees that were merely checked for edible fruit, but where monitoring could not have been triggered by olfactory or auditory cues because the tree did not carry fruit, were also significantly larger. Most trees were monitored along the way during travel, but 13% were approached in a goal-directed manner (assessed using a 'change point test'). These approaches were unlikely to have been initiated by visual cues and occurred more often when females foraged solitarily and when trees were large as opposed to small. Our results suggest that goal-directed monitoring is guided by a long-term 'what-where' memory of the location of large potential food sources. These findings were confirmed in a quasiexperiment that tested which of 15 876 potential food trees with different crown sizes were approached in a goal-directed manner. Observations on one female who was followed intensively over 3 consecutive years indicated that monitoring probability was highest for trees with which she had become more familiar through frequent previous visits and that had carried more fruit, suggesting that she was able to remember this information across fruiting seasons. Long-term phenological data on individual trees indicated that the interval between successive fruiting seasons, and hence the 'memory window' of chimpanzees required for effective monitoring activities, could be up to 3 years.

Sole use of movement patterns has been recognized as problematic because movements are often related to activities other than foraging (e.g., reproduction). Consequently, intraspecific variation in foraging behavior and its ecological consequences (e.g., diet variation) have been dramatically under studied. In this study, we examined the foraging behavior and diet of the Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi). Our objectives were 1) to quantify the variation in foraging behavior through the activity season to document how movement and foraging varies between sexes across the breeding and post-breeding seasons, 2) to quantify the efficacy of movement patterns versus attack-based metrics in detecting variation, and 3) to quantify the dietary consequences of variation in foraging. We found no differences in movement patterns between seasons or sexes, but we did find sexual variation in attack behavior and corresponding seasonal and sexual variation in diet. Indeed, a new attack-based index, attacks while stationary (AWS), was able to show precisely how foraging patterns varied. Combining attack-based indices and lag sequential analysis provided a complete description of how prey was acquired compared with using movement patterns alone.

Hence, variation in local ambient temperature can influence the diet composition of migrant birds, and, consequently, they may be constrained by which stopover and wintering sites they are able to utilize during periods of colder temperatures. Here, we use fecal analysis, observer-based population counts, digital video recordings, and temperature data to test five predictions regarding the influence of local ambient temperature on the activity and availability of mudflat crabs-a key prey resource at three staging/wintering sites in eastern China, for migratory Red-crowned cranes (Grus japonensis) and how this subsequently influences crane diet and use of wetland sites. Pearson's correlations and generalized linear models revealed that mudflat crabs became significantly more surface active with increasing burrow ambient temperature. Piecewise regression analysis revealed that crab surface activity was largely limited to a burrow ambient temperature threshold between 12 and 13celcius after which activity significantly increased. Crab activity declining temporally during the crane's autumn migration period but increased during spring migration. Crabs accounted for a significant proportion of crane diet at two of three sites; however, the frequency of crab remains was significantly different between sites, and between autumn and spring migration. Analyses of crane count data revealed a degree of congruence between the migration timing of Red-crowned cranes with periods of warmer ambient temperature, and a significant, positive correlation between the percentage of crab remains in crane feces and site ambient temperature.

The optimal foraging theory explains diet selection by several attributes of the trophic scenario such as availability, diversity, quality and predictability of food. Other models propose that digestive tract mass increases under high metabolic demands by cold, affecting food choice and intake. Thus, diet selection emerges as a behavioural trait shaped by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The goal of our study was to determine variation in the trophic scenario among sites at different elevations, as well as variation in phenotypic traits relevant to the nutritional and energy balance in Phyllotis xanthopygus. This small rodent is widely distributed along the Andes Mountains. We assessed diet selection and digestive tract size in individuals collected at three elevations across its distribution range. Results on dietary proportion of specific trophic categories (green parts, fruits and arthropods) showed that P. xanthopygus alternates between omnivory and granivory/frugivory. Richness, diversity and quality of the available resources evidenced a relatively low-quality trophic scenario at high altitude. Nevertheless, the diets built in by animals from diverse altitudes lacked differentiation in quality or diversity. P. xanthopygus seems to behaviourally compensate environmental variation to cope with nutritional requirements, by changing diet composition and proportion of items included. The resultant uniform diet quality is consistent with the absence of variation in the gastrointestinal tract size. Considering the spatial variability and seasonality of the region, a behavioural response is probably the most convenient strategy to overcome short-term environmental heterogeneity. In a plastic species such as P. xanthopygus, behaviour is a fundamental aspect to take into account by predictive models in the forecasts of climate change effects on biological diversity.",2017,10.1080/03949370.2016.1188158,yes,ethology,obs,Phyllotis_xanthopygus,rodent,mammal,fecal_analysis,59,n/a,,,120,A,no,n/a,diet_composition,"also sacrificed and analysis gut contents, but basically that's the same as these fecals",

Species that display carotenoid-based yellow, orange, or red plumage are therefore expected to forage selectively for carotenoid-rich foods when they are depositing these pigments during molt, but whether they actually do so is unknown. We set out to address this in the hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a New Zealand passerine where males, but not females, display yellow carotenoid-based plumage. We measured circulating carotenoid concentrations in male and female hihi during breeding and molt, determined the nutritional content of common foods in the hihi diet, and conducted feeding observations of male and female hihi during molt. We found that although male and female hihi do not differ significantly in plasma carotenoid concentration, male hihi have a greater proportion of carotenoid-rich foods in their diet than do females. This is a consequence of a greater fruit and lower invertebrate intake than females and an avoidance of low-carotenoid content fruit.

Here, we studied the combined effects of ecological and social factors on seasonal grouping patterns in a sedentary population of Egyptian vultures living on the Eastern Canary Islands. We focussed on the social significance of large-scale gatherings taking place outside the breeding season at a highly preferred feeding station and a nearby temporary roost. Group sizes at this feeding patch followed a strong seasonal pattern characterized by distinct monthly changes in group composition, according to sex, age and territorial status. In between reproductive periods, vulture numbers at the feeding station may reach up 50% of the total population on a single day. GPS-tracking showed that this increase in vulture numbers was in part due to a shift in foraging range towards the centre of Fuerteventura by low-ranked territorial birds breeding in remote areas. During this period, vultures may spend on average 30% of their monthly time in a social gatherings context, depending on social status. We show that seasonal grouping patterns are shaped by the complex interplay between ecological factors (reproductive constraints, resource seasonality, food predictability), age-specific traits and social competitive processes, while social attraction may be an important additional component.

Female mammals trade off investment in growth and survival against complex and resource-intensive reproductive challenges; thus, they alter behaviours according to changing priorities. To maximize net gain females increase resource intake or limit its expenditure. Behaviours that involve resource acquisition, such as foraging, are potentially rewarding, yet lead to competition, especially in group-living species; whereas behaviours that do not provide resources, such as resting or grooming, encourage sharing and buffer competition. In cooperative species with linear dominance hierarchies such as female African elephants (Loxodonta africana africana), rank is often determined by age and size, which are highly correlated. When compared with younger, competitively disadvantaged individuals, higher ranked animals attain greater access to resources, but other phenotypic and environmental factors may influence their needs. Hence, we examined how lactational status and sex of the nursing offspring influenced time spent on resource acquisition, and we assessed how these factors affect rates of aggression related to age. We conducted the study at Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa from June to December 2010, using 20 min focal animal sampling on reproductively mature females (N = 109).

They, therefore, do not account for the variability of behavior of semiaquatic animals, and the switching between terrestrial and aquatic environments. This is the first study to use hidden Markov models (HMM) to divide dives of a semiaquatic animal into clusters and thus identify the environmental predictors of transition between behavioral modes. We used 18 existing data sets of the dives of 14 American mink (Neovison vison) fitted with time-depth recorders in lowland England. Using HMM, we identified 3 behavioral states (1, temporal cluster of dives; 2, more loosely aggregated diving within aquatic activity; and 3, terminal dive of a cluster or a single, isolated dive). Based on the higher than expected proportion of dives in State 1, we conclude that mink tend to dive in clusters. We found no relationship between temperature and the proportion of dives in each state or between temperature and the rate of transition between states, meaning that in our study area, mink are apparently not adopting different diving strategies at different temperatures. Transition analysis between states has shown that there is no correlation between ambient temperature and the likelihood of mink switching from one state to another, that is, changing foraging modes.

Information on distribution, foraging patterns, and exposure routes of loons are needed for understanding the physical and ecological factors that contribute to avian botulism outbreaks. Aerial surveys were conducted to document the spatiotemporal distribution of common loons on Lake Michigan during falls 2011-2013. In addition, satellite telemetry and archival geolocator tags were used to determine the distribution and foraging patterns of individual common loons while using Lake Michigan during fall migration. Common loon distribution observed during aerial surveys and movements of individual radiomarked and/or geotagged loons suggest a seasonal pattern of use, with early fall use of Green Bay and northern Lake Michigan followed by a shift in distribution to southern Lake Michigan before moving on to wintering areas. Common loons tended to occupy offshore areas of Lake Michigan and, on average, spent the majority of daylight hours foraging. Dive depths were as deep as 60 m and dive characteristics suggested that loons were primarily foraging on benthic prey. A recent study concluded that round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) are an important prey item of common loons and may be involved in transmission of botulinum neurotoxin type E. Loon distribution coincides with the distribution of dreissenid mussel biomass, an important food resource for round gobies. Our observations support speculation that energy transfer to higher trophic levels via gobies may occur in deep-water habitats, along with transfer of botulinum neurotoxin.

We used radio-telemetry data from three winters to document winter movements of 30 rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) in Texas. Snakes moved in all months, although there was substantial individual and gender-based variation. Consistent with active snakes foraging, monthly variation in movement was associated with availability of thermal windows that would allow digestion of a meal. Females were more active than males, suggesting increased foraging demands. Individual activity in winter was positively correlated with activity the previous summer, particular among females. This may reflect enduring effects of variation in reproductive costs, or intrinsic variation in activity of individual snakes.

Many types of lateralisation are linked to the function of each brain hemisphere. Lateralisation of monitoring behaviour in mother-infant relationships occurs in a wide range of mammals, where infants frequently use their left eye to monitor their mother. However, few studies have focused on this type of spatial relationships among adults in daily life, such as during foraging. The present study focused on monitoring adult feral horse behaviour using quantitative analysis of spatial relationships, using drone technology. We found that horses form a localised spatial relationship with their nearest neighbour. Specifically, the nearest neighbour was located to the left rear of a target individual significantly more frequently than to the right rear. Furthermore, the nearest neighbour was less frequently located behind a target individual.

Eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls enhances predator avoidance, reduces time spent vigilant and allows for more time on daily activities such as foraging. If the information is relevant and reliable, individuals that respond to heterospecific signals may benefit from a wider range of information at a low marginal cost. The Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris)and crowned lapwing (Vanellus chilensis) are ground-dwelling species that are taxonomically distant but share similar predators, habitat and anti-predatory behaviours. We used playback experiments of the alarm calls produced by conspecifics and lapwings to investigate the vigilance responses of adult female Cape ground squirrels. Squirrels responded with greater vigilance to both squirrel and lapwing alarm calls, and no changes of vigilance levels were observed in response to a control sound. However, contrary to our predictions, changes in vigilance and time to relax did not differ between conspecific versus heterospecific playbacks.

However, little is known regarding its importance for the organization of cross-taxa community structure. Furthermore, the possibility that eavesdropping could allow species to coexist with a predator and access risky foraging habitat, thereby expanding their realized niche, has been little considered. Kalahari tree skinks (Trachylepis spilogaster) associate with sociable weaver (Philetairus socius) colonies as do African pygmy falcons (Polihierax semitorquatus), a predator of skinks and weavers. We undertook observational and experimental tests to determine if skinks eavesdrop on sociable weavers to mitigate any increase in predation threat that associating with weaver colonies may bring. Observations reveal that skinks use information from weavers to determine when predators are nearby; skinks were more active, more likely to forage in riskier habitats, and initiated flight from predators earlier in the presence of weavers compared with when weavers were absent. Playback of weaver alarm calls caused skinks to increase vigilance and flee, confirming that skinks eavesdrop on weavers. Furthermore, skinks at sociable weaver colonies were more likely to flee than skinks at noncolony trees, suggesting that learning is mechanistically important for eavesdropping behavior. Overall, it appears that eavesdropping allows skinks at colony trees to gain an early warning signal of potential predators, expand their realized niche, and join communities, whose predators may otherwise exclude them.",2020,10.1093/beheco/araa057,yes,ethology,obs,Trachylepis_spilogaster,lizard,reptile,direct_obs,80,0.06,n/a,2,60,B,no,vigilance,"eavesdropping, antipredator_response, playback, FID",do skinks use weaver calls to avoid predation by falcons,

For example, animals use or eavesdrop on heterospecific alarm calls concerning common predators. Indeed, most observations have been reported regarding anti-predator strategies. Use of heterospecific signals has rarely been observed as part of a foraging strategy. Here, I report empirical evidence;collected using playback experiments, showing that Japanese sika deer, Cevus nippon, use heterospecific food calls of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata yakui, for foraging efficiency. The deer and macaques both inhabit the wild forest of Yakushima Island with high population densities and share many food items. Anecdotal observations suggest that deer often wait to browse fruit falls under the tree where a macaque group is foraging. Furthermore, macaques frequently produce food calls during their foraging. If deer effectively obtain fruit from the leftovers of macaques, browsing fruit fall would provide a potential benefit to the deer, and, further, deer are likely to associate macaque food calls with feeding activity. The results showed that playback of macaque food calls under trees gathered significantly more deer than silence control periods. These results suggest that deer can associate macaque food calls with foraging activities and use heterospecific calls for foraging efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We tested whether music, broadcast loudly, affects bats' foraging and drinking behaviour. The study was done at two waterbodies, where bats drink and forage in the Negev Desert, Israel, during summertime, when water availability is limited: both sites, one isolated natural pond and one artificial waterbody, frequently host recreational parties and concerts. We broadcast music whose frequency range did not overlap with that of bat echolocation calls, and acoustically assessed bat activity before and after the music broadcast. At the remote waterbody, used by bats as a drinking site, the number of bat passes did not vary between treatments. However, after music was broadcast, bats performed significantly more unsuccessful drinking attempts. At the artificial waterbody-a foraging site-activity decreased significantly after music was broadcast. Additionally, music had a cumulative effect on bats, since overall activity significantly decreased over the experimental period.

V.; Mwanguhya, Francis; Kyabulima, Solomon; Cant, Michael A.",Food availability shapes patterns of helping effort in a cooperative mongoose,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"In cooperatively breeding vertebrate societies, contributions to offspring care can vary greatly between group members. Kin selection theory predicts that cooperation will be favoured when directed towards relatives and when the cost to benefit ratio is low. The fitness costs of helping in turn depend on the impact of energetic investments in care on future reproductive success, which is likely to vary between helpers. For example, investments may impact more on a young helper, which needs to invest energy in growth and is an inexperienced forager. We investigated how a key predictor of cost, food availability (estimated using rainfall), influences helping behaviour in the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. In this cooperative carnivore, a variable number of group members breed while almost all help to rear the communal litter. Nonbreeding females and juvenile males helped less when food was scarce, reflecting the potentially high costs of weight loss and reduced growth on survival and future reproductive success. In contrast, adult males maintained their investment in care as food supply decreased, probably because body condition has relatively little impact on male reproductive success in this species. Breeding females (with pups in the communal litter) also maintained their helping effort as food supply decreased. Although mothers invested highly in care, there was no evidence that they preferentially cared for their own pups, probably because synchronized birthing scrambles maternity cues. Patterns of care in the banded mongoose thus seem to reflect the benefits gained from helping and the long-term fitness costs to the helper.

While many studies have linked migratory ungulate declines to migration disruption or loss, very few have explored the underlying factors that determine whether a population perishes or persists. In some cases, populations undergo severe declines and extirpation after migration loss; however, others appear able to persist as residents. We predict that to persist, populations must replace the traditional benefits of migration by altering the foraging strategies they employ as residents within one seasonal range. We propose the alternative foraging strategies (AFS) hypothesis as a framework for identifying various behavioral strategies that populations may use to cope with migration loss. We tested the hypothesis using the formerly migratory Teton bighorn sheep population in northwest Wyoming, which ceased migrating over 60 yr ago, but has persisted as a resident population. We used global positioning system data to evaluate winter and summer habitat selection and seasonal elevational movements for 28 adult female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) from 2008 to 2010. Resource selection functions revealed that bighorn sheep employ winter foraging strategies to survive as residents by seeking out rugged, high-elevation, windswept ridgelines. Seasonal movement analyses indicated that bighorn sheep undergo a newly documented abbreviated migration strategy that is closely synchronized with vegetation green-up patterns within their one range. Bighorn sheep descend 500 m in elevation and travel up to 10 km in spring, gaining access to newly emergent forage approximately 30 d before it appears on their high-elevation winter and summer ranges. Our findings indicate that the Teton bighorn sheep population has persisted due to its habitat selection, AFS, and unique movement patterns, which allow migration loss to be mediated to some extent. The identification of AFS and the habitats that support them can help reveal the underlying benefits of migration and conserve populations in the face of future migration loss.",2017,10.1002/ecs2.1855,yes,remote,obs,Ovis_canadensis,ungulate,mammal,"direct_obs, ethogram",64,n/a,0.010416667,,240,AB,yes,vigilance,ethogram,"also deployed GPS collars and studied habitat selection, but the direct obs of foraging effort was more relevant",

We measured the surface density of the ant prey in 1-m(2) quadrats placed in 2 habitat types that had different thermal properties: open grassland and forest. The density of ants varied according to year of the study, habitat type, date during the summer, and time of day and was strongly associated with ambient temperature. In the shaded forest habitat, ant density increased linearly with air temperatures between 6 and 28 degrees C. In contrast, the surface activity of ants in the open habitat exposed to sun began to decline once ground surface temperatures reached 26 degrees C. Ant densities were higher in the open habitat than in the shade in relatively cold conditions but were higher in the shaded forest habitat when it was hot.

Robinson_2013,"Robinson, Barry G.; Merrill, Evelyn H.",Foraging-vigilance trade-offs in a partially migratory population: comparing migrants and residents on a sympatric range,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Prey often suffer foraging costs associated with antipredator behaviours such as vigilance. Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance. However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus, predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours.

Because individuals have limited resources, time allocation and risk decisions are expected to vary according to the care status and threat faced by parents. Herein, we evaluated the sources of mortality of clutches of the glassfrogHyalinobatrachium cappelleiand the importance of paternal care for offspring survival. We also compared time allocation patterns and antipredator behavior between attending and non-attending males. Using naturalistic observations and field experiments with different dummy predators, we hypothesized that (1) offspring survival would be positively correlated with paternal care; (2) attending males would spend most of the time caring for the embryos, while non-attending males would spend more time foraging and calling; (3) attending males would prioritize their own survival when facing a high risk of predation, even with negative impacts on offspring survival. Main sources of embryo mortality included predation and dehydration, and offspring survivorship was almost totally dependent on paternal care. Although non-attending males spent more time calling and foraging, attending males also called and were able to attract females and increase their mating success. However, contrary to our prediction, we found that attending males were more risk-tolerant, increasing not only offspring survival but also their mortality risk. Our findings highlight the importance of the predation risk level on parents' decisions and that the reproductive status may play a significant role in determining antipredator behavior and mating success in glassfrog males. Significance statement In species with parental care, parents face a trade-off between investment in current offspring survival and chances of future reproduction. Hence, it is expected that natural selection will favor parents that attend offspring without incurring in higher risk of predation. We investigated time allocation patterns and behavioral responses to different levels of threat in a glassfrog with paternal care. Using field observations and predation experiments, we found that attending and non-attending males ofHyalinobatrachium cappelleibehaved differently depending on their care status and level of threat. Males were more likely to tolerate high risks only when they were caring for clutches. We also found that the commitment of males to continue caring resulted in higher offspring survival.

Anthropogenic developments along coasts can increase ambient light levels at night across adjacent inter-tidal zones. Here, we report the effects of elevated nocturnal light levels upon the foraging strategy of a migratory shorebird (common redshank Tringa totanus) overwintering on an industrialised estuary in Northern Europe. To monitor behaviour across the full intertidal area, individuals were located by day and night using VHF transmitters, and foraging behaviour was inferred from inbuilt posture sensors. Natural light was scored using moon-phase and cloud cover information and nocturnal artificial light levels were obtained using geo-referenced DMSP/OLS night-time satellite imagery at a 1-km resolution. Under high illumination levels, the commonest and apparently preferred foraging behaviour was sight-based. Conversely, birds feeding in areas with low levels of artificial light had an elevated foraging time and fed by touch, but switched to visual rather than tactile foraging behaviour on bright moonlit nights in the absence of cloud cover. Individuals occupying areas which were illuminated continuously by lighting from a large petrochemical complex invariably exhibited a visually based foraging behaviour independently of lunar phase and cloud cover. We show that ambient light levels affect the timing and distribution of foraging opportunities for redshank. We argue that light emitted from an industrial complex improved nocturnal visibility. This allowed sight-based foraging in place of tactile foraging, implying both a preference for sight-feeding and enhanced night-time foraging opportunities under these conditions.

Here, we provide basic information about burrow systems, home ranges, activity, morphometric measures, and reproductive behaviour. We monitored 10 individuals through VHF telemetry and direct observations in the central Pantanal of Brazil for 24 months. Males (2.06 km(2)) had significantly larger home ranges than females (0.59 km(2)) and home ranges of males overlapped with those of several females. There was very little overlap in ranges of the same sex and very few social interactions were observed. Southern naked-tailed armadillos dug convoluted galleries to forage, and, unless they used their entrance to exit, they emerged on average 2 m away (ranging from 0.01 m to 17 m) from the burrow entrance. When leaving their burrows, they spend on average 6.5 min above ground, travelling an average of 83 m (ranging from 1 m to 781 m) before going back underground. They do not return to sleep in a particular burrow, changing burrows frequently. The studied armadillos were diurnal, and spend 99.25% of the day underground, emerging only during the hottest period of the day (mid-afternoon). The southern naked-tailed armadillos should be classified as a subterranean species, rather than fossorial since they spent most of their time underground where foraging also takes place.

Wood_2021a,"Wood, Kevin A.; Newth, Julia L.; Hilton, Geoff M.; Rees, Eileen C.",Behavioural and energetic consequences of competition among three overwintering swan (Cygnus spp.) species,AVIAN RESEARCH,"Background Winter numbers of the northwest European population of Bewick's Swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) declined recently by c. 40%. During the same period, numbers of two sympatric and ecologically-similar congeners, the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) and Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) showed increases or stability. It has been suggested that these opposing population trends could have a causal relationship, as Mute and Whooper Swans are larger and competitively dominant to Bewick's Swans in foraging situations. If so, effects of competition of Mute and Whooper Swans on Bewick's Swans should be detectable as measurable impacts on behaviour and energetics. Methods Here, we studied the diurnal behaviour and energetics of 1083 focal adults and first-winter juveniles (cygnets) of the three swan species on their winter grounds in eastern England. We analysed video recordings to derive time-activity budgets and these, together with estimates of energy gain and expenditure, were analysed to determine whether individual Bewick's Swans altered the time spent on key behaviours when sharing feeding habitat with other swan species, and any consequences for their energy expenditure and net energy gain. Results All three swan species spent a small proportion of their total time (0.011) on aggressive interactions, and these were predominantly intraspecific (>= 0.714). Mixed-effects models indicated that sharing feeding habitat with higher densities of Mute and Whooper Swans increased the likelihood of engaging in aggression for cygnet Bewick's Swans, but not for adults. Higher levels of interspecific competition decreased the time spent by Bewick's Swan cygnets on foraging, whilst adults showed the opposite pattern. When among low densities of conspecifics (< c. 200 individuals/km(2)), individual Bewick's Swans spent more time on vigilance in the presence of higher densities of Mute and Whooper Swans, whilst individuals within higher density Bewick's Swan flocks showed the opposite pattern. Crucially, we found no evidence that greater numbers of interspecific competitors affected the net energy gain of either adult or cygnet Bewick's Swans. Conclusions We found no evidence that Bewick's Swan net energy gain was affected by sharing agricultural feeding habitat with larger congeners during winter. This was despite some impacts on the aggression, foraging and vigilance behaviours of Bewick's Swans, especially among cygnets. It is unlikely therefore that competition between Bewick's Swans and either Mute or Whooper Swans at arable sites in winter has contributed to the observed decline in Bewick's Swan numbers.

F.; Aprilinayati, Fikty; van Noordwijk, Maria A.; van Schaik, Carel P.",Observational social learning and socially induced practice of routine skills in immature wild orang-utans,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Experiments have shown that captive great apes are capable of observational learning, and patterns of cultural variation between populations suggest that they use this capacity in the wild. So far, the contexts and extent of observational forms of social learning in the wild remain unclear. Social learning is expected to be most pronounced during the skill acquisition of immature individuals. We therefore examined peering (attentive close range watching) by immatures in two populations of wild orangutans, Pongo spp. We found, first, that peering was most frequent in contexts in which learning is expected, namely feeding and nest building. Second, peering in the feeding context was significantly positively correlated with complexity of food processing and negatively with an item's frequency in the mother's diet. Food peering was also followed by significantly increased rates of exploratory behaviours targeting the same food items, indicating that it leads to selective practice. Food peering also decreased with age and increasing feeding competence of the immatures. Third, the age of peak peering in the nesting context coincided with the onset of nest practice behaviour, and peering events were followed by significantly increased rates of this behaviour. Fourth, the proportion of peering directed at other individuals rather than the mother increased with age. These findings are consistent with the prediction that immature orang-utans learn by observing others in a variety of contexts and that peering is followed by selective practice of the observed behaviour. We conclude that observational social learning in combination with socially induced practice over a period of several years is a critical component of the acquisition of learned subsistence skills in orang-utans.

Allan; Kam, Michael","Seasonal biotic and abiotic factors affecting hunting strategy in free-living Saharan sand vipers, Cerastes vipera",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,"Sit-and-wait ambushing and active hunting are two strategies used by predators to capture prey. In snakes, hunting strategy is conserved phylogenetically; most species employ only one strategy. Active hunters encounter and capture more prey but invest more energy in hunting and have higher risks of being predated. This trade-off is important to small predators. The small Cerastes vipera employs both modes of hunting, which is unlike most viperids which use only sit-and wait ambushing. This species hibernates in October and emerges in April. Energy intake should be high prior to hibernation to overcome the non-feeding hibernation period and for reproduction on their emergence. We predicted that more individuals would hunt actively towards hibernation and an abiotic factor would trigger this response. Furthermore, since more energy is required for active hunting, we predicted that snakes in good body condition would use active hunting to a greater extent than snakes in poor body condition. To test our predictions, we tracked free-living snakes year round and determined their hunting strategy, estimated their body condition index (BCI), and calculated circannual parameters of day length as environmental cues known to affect animal behaviour. Two novel findings emerged in this study, namely, hunting strategy was affected significantly by 1) the circannual change in day length and 2) by BCI. The proportion of active hunters increased from 5% in April to over 30% in October and BCI of active foragers was higher than that of sit-and-wait foragers and, therefore, our predictions were supported. The entrainment between the proportion of active hunting and the abiotic factor is indicative of an adaptive function for choosing a hunting strategy. A trend was evident among life stages. When all life stages were present (September-October), the proportion of active foragers increased with age: 0.0% among neonates, 18.2% among juveniles and 31.4% among adults. We concluded that vulnerable small neonates used sit-and-wait ambush not only as a hunting strategy but also as a hiding technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We relate lemur foraging behaviour to fruit traits by calculating touching, visual inspection, and sniffing indices and relate lemur foraging efficiency to fruit traits by calculating acceptance indices. The use of different sensory modalities by lemurs is marginally predicted in one case by fruit traits-fruits with higher overall smell signals are sniffed less than fruits with lower overall smell signals.

However, inferring foraging strategies is often difficult because of challenges associated with empirically estimating energetic costs and gains of foraging in the field. We generated qualitative predictions for the relationship between daily winter foraging time, body size and forage availability for three contrasting foraging strategies including time minimization, energy intake maximization and net energy maximization. Our model predicts that for animals employing a time minimization strategy, daily winter foraging time should not change with body size and should increase with a reduction in forage availability. For energy intake maximization, foraging time should not vary with either body size or forage availability. In contrast, for a net energy maximization strategy, foraging time should decrease with increase in body size and with a reduction in forage availability. We contrasted proportion of daily time spent foraging by bharal, Pseudois nayaur, a dimorphic grazer, across different body size classes in two high-altitude sites differing in forage availability. Our results indicate that bharal behave as net energy maximizers during winter. As predicted by the net energy maximization strategy, daily winter foraging time of bharal declined with increasing body size, and was lower in the site with low forage availability. Furthermore, as predicted by our model, foraging time declined as the winter season progressed. We did not find support for the time minimizing or energy intake maximizing strategies. Our qualitative model uses relative rather than absolute costs and gains of foraging which are often difficult to estimate in the field. It thus offers a simple way to make informed inferences regarding animal foraging strategies by contrasting estimates of daily foraging time across gradients of body size and forage availability.

Correlation between flock size and period of the day, and their similar effects on bird behaviour may be evidence that groups of different sizes could have different functions throughout the day.

We analysed sequences of behaviour of 40 wild rheas, foraging solitarily or in groups of 2 to 17 individuals, in two populations in eastern Argentina. We used parametric (auto and cross-correlations) and non-parametric (runs and Spearman rank correlation) tests to detect dependence among intervals. We detected the temporal dependence of inter-scan intervals in 30 of 40 behavioural series, but only 11 of 40 sequences showed consistent dependence when tested using parametric and non-parametric tests. The temporal dependence detected in some individual sequences would still be used by predators to synchronise their attacks with long inattentive periods of the prey. However, simple simulations showed that attack success would not be different from that of predators launching their attacks at the beginning of a randomly selected inattentive period of the prey.

Courant_2012,"Courant, Sabrina; Fortin, Daniel",Search efficiency of free-ranging plains bison for optimal food items,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Optimal decisions in classical foraging models depend on the encounter rate with food items that are often distributed heterogeneously at one or multiple spatial scales. Only a few studies, however, provide a detailed assessment of the determinants of foraging efficiency by free-ranging animals across spatial scales. We evaluated multilevel search efficiency of free-ranging plains bison, Bison bison bison, and whether it varies with social factors, sex and season. We assessed search efficiency by contrasting encounters with the most profitable plant species, Carex atherodes, from random expectations within meadows or along foraging paths. We found that bison selectively occupied areas of meadows rich in C. atherodes. Once in these areas, females took shorter steps in locations of high C. atherodes biomass in summer and winter, as expected from an area-restricted search tactic. In winter, the presence of conspecifics further increased the chances of finding locations of high C. atherodes biomass, presumably due to social information. Unlike females, once males were in areas generally rich in C. atherodes during summer, they moved towards locations with lower C. atherodes biomass more than expected by chance alone. The fine-scale movement strategy of males does not appear to maximize instantaneous energy intake rate, but might reflect a tactic for efficient guarding of females during the rut. Overall, our study shows that the efficiency with which free-ranging herbivores find high-quality food during social foraging strongly differs between sexes, and depends on conspecific distribution and season.

Redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) produce different types of close calls: grunts, long grunts, hoos and meows. In order to study the function of these calls, we conducted focal observations and vocal recordings from eight adult males and females out of four social groups in Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar. Redfronted lemurs produce long grunts, hoos and meows at relatively low rates during foraging, resting or group movements, respectively. Grunts were given most often and more or less constantly during foraging and traveling. Calling rate increased when the risk of separation increased and may thus promote group cohesion. Grunts given during approaches of other group members resulted more often in friendly interactions than approaches that were not accompanied by a grunt. Thus, redfronted lemurs produce specific but also generic contact calls, whereas the latter calls have a dual function that varies depending on the addressed audience: they act as an auditory beacon to maintain group cohesion and serve as signals of benign intent to avoid costly conflicts and facilitating social interactions.",2012,10.1007/s10071-012-0507-9,yes,ethology,obs,Eulemur_rufifrons,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, ethogram",16,n/a,0.166666667,,n/a,AB,yes,ethogram,"ethogram, activity_budget, vocalizations","doesn't say how many obs periods per animal, but 4h is the amount of recordings of calls... no mention of total study duration",

Here we used data from two wild vervet monkey, Chlorocebus pygerythru,s groups to assess whether the detection of predators affected their subsequent behaviour to the detriment of their short-term foraging effort. Encounters with the three predator classes present at our study site were frequent and there was evidence that animals were more likely to shift to predatorfocused vigilance, which was modulated by alarm call intensity, but not predator type, in the hour following detection. Nevertheless, and against expectation, there was no detectable shift in overall levels of vigilance, which remained low, interindividual distances, travel bearing and, consequently, effort put into foraging. We consider this surprising imperturbability by our study groups in the context of population group size, as our groups are large and have correspondingly lower levels of individual vigilance, as well as in terms of the constraints imposed by small, overlapping territories and frequent predator encounters. Finally, we advocate for increased consideration of the responses of the predators themselves to detection by their prey. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

D.",Polar bear foraging on common eider eggs: estimating the energetic consequences of a climate-mediated behavioural shift,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Climate-mediated phenological shifts can cause species to lose access to their primary prey while increasing opportunities for alternative-prey encounters. Species that are able to capitalize on alternative resources could potentially profit from prey-switching should the benefits of procuring these alternative resources outweigh their acquisition costs. Polar bears, Ursus maritimus, use sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, and individuals inhabiting the southern-most extent of their range rely on accumulated fat reserves to sustain themselves during the increasingly lengthy ice-free season. In response to declining access to their primary prey through documented sea ice loss, some polar bears are foraging on the eggs of birds in lieu of hunting opportunities on ice, as their onshore arrival is increasingly overlapping with birds' breeding schedules. To gain a better understanding of the energetic consequences of this behaviour, we used aerial drones to record polar bears foraging on sea duck eggs (common eider, Somateria mollissima) on Mitivik Island, Nunavut, Canada. Using these data, we examined variation in individual polar bear foraging behaviours and estimated the energetic benefits and costs associated with foraging on common eider eggs. Because of low costs associated with nest searching and consumption, the energetic cost of foraging remained relatively constant throughout the 2-week observation period. However, we found that as the common eider breeding season progressed, polar bears consumed eggs at a lower rate as they depleted the nesting colony and spent proportionally more time searching for nests. Collectively, this foraging pattern led to an overall declining trend in the net energy gained from egg consumption. Foraging on common eider eggs during increasingly lengthy ice-free seasons is apparently beneficial for polar bears, but only during a limited window of opportunity. By coupling energetic estimates with detailed behavioural data collected through aerial videography, this study provides a quantification of both the benefits and costs of egg consumption for polar bears.

L.",Tai chimpanzees change their travel direction for rare feeding trees providing fatty fruits,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"The production of edible rainforest fruits is characterized by fluctuating and seasonal patterns that require frugivores to flexibly adjust their ranging behaviour. We investigated whether significant changes in a forager's travel direction can inform us about the importance of the nutritional and energetic aspects of different food sources for a wild animal's diet. We recorded the ranging patterns of five adult female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, for a total of 275 full days in the TaI National Park in Cote d'Ivoire and designed two models that predicted their directional changes at, and on the way to, fruit -bearing feeding trees. In both models, directional change was significantly influenced by the density of the feeding tree species and the crude fat content of that species' fruit. Female chimpanzees were more likely to change their travel direction for rarer trees, at which they fed on fruits that contained higher amounts of fat. In addition, directional changes tended to be positively influenced by the content of nonstructural ('easy energy') and structural carbohydrates (NDF) in that species' fruit. We did not detect any effect of sensory cues or social factors on the directional changes, in either model. The amount of fruit available and the time since the start of the fruiting season positively influenced directional change in the second model, which suggests that chimpanzees were updating their knowledge of the fruit availability in individual trees over time. Our results indicate that the nutrient content of fruit and its abundance exerted a significant impact on the shape of chimpanzee female travel paths, which opens up a new avenue for investigation of food preferences in wild animals through analyses of their ranging patterns.

Hirsch_2011a,"Hirsch, Ben T.",Spatial position and feeding success in ring-tailed coatis,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"The location of an animal within a social group has important effects on feeding success. When animals consume quickly eaten food items, individuals located at the front edge of a group typically have greater foraging success. When groups feed at large clumped resources, dominant individuals can often monopolize the resource, leading to higher feeding success in the center of the group. In order to test these predictions, behavioral data relating foraging success to within-group spatial position were recorded from two habituated groups of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) in Iguazu, Argentina. Foraging success did not fit expected patterns. When feeding on small ground litter invertebrates, coatis had the same foraging success at all spatial positions. This pattern likely resulted from an abundance of invertebrates in the ground litter. When feeding on fruit, individuals in the front of the group had greater feeding success, which was driven by the relatively quick depletion of fruit trees. Dominant juveniles were often located in the front of the group which led to increased access to food. This resulted in higher feeding success on fruits but simultaneously increased their risk of predation. Although groups typically became more elongated and traveled faster when feeding on fruit, it did not appear that the coatis were drastically changing their spacing strategies when switching between the two food types. Paradoxically, spatial position preferences during invertebrate foraging appeared to be driven by fruit trees. Because fruit trees were encountered so frequently, juveniles ranging at the front edge of the group during invertebrate foraging were the first to arrive at fruit trees and thus had higher foraging success. This study demonstrates the importance of how food patch size and depletion rate affect the spatial preferences of individuals.",2011,10.1007/s00265-010-1058-1,yes,ethology,obs,Nasua_nasua,carnivore,mammal,"radio_tracking, direct_obs",67,n/a,0.007728718,,570,ABC,yes,ethogram,"ethogram, habituation, social",,
Sharpe_2016,"Sharpe, Lynda L.; Rubow, Janneke; Cherry, Michael I.",Robbing rivals: interference foraging competition reflects female reproductive competition in a cooperative mammal,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Intense intrasexual competition for breeding opportunities is a characteristic of cooperatively breeding species with high reproductive skew. In such 'singular' cooperative breeders, females suffer greater variability in direct reproductive success than do males, and this in turn leads to greater intrasexual competition in females. Under such circumstances, selection should favour traits that enhance female competitive ability, such as size, fighting skill or aggression. However, despite burgeoning interest in female intrasexual competition, there is limited evidence that female cooperative breeders exhibit more pronounced competitive traits than do males. We examined whether intrasexual competition has influenced the expression of a competitive behavioural trait (i.e. prey theft) in a 'singular', cooperatively breeding mammal, the dwarf mongoose, Helogale parvula. We used both observational and experimental data to assess whether wild dwarf mongooses exploit interference foraging competition to persecute their reproductive rivals, and whether the sexes differ with regard to this behaviour. We found that nonalpha female mongooses preferentially stole from other females rather than males, and that, under natural foraging conditions, they were more likely to steal prey from their closest rival (i.e. the female immediately below themselves in the dominance hierarchy) than from easier targets much lower in rank. In contrast, male dwarf mongooses (and alpha females) did not exhibit any sex bias, stealing prey indiscriminately from all lower ranking group members. We conclude that the acute intrasexual rivalry suffered by female dwarf mongooses has led to the differential development of this competitive behavioural trait.

Here, we aim to elucidate the processes behind a previously established age-related foraging distribution of red knots (Calidris canutus canutus) in their main wintering area in West Africa (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania). Based on 10 years of observations of 1232 uniquely color-ringed individuals of 1 to 18+ years old, we examined whether the observed age-related foraging distribution resulted from 1) spatial differences in mortality or 2) age-related shifts in habitat use. Using multistate capture-recapture modeling, we showed that with age foraging red knots moved away from the shoreline, that is, to areas with fewer surprise attacks by raptors. Considering uncertainties in the subjective gradient in predation danger with increasing distance from shore (as assessed from correlations between vigilance and distance from shore in foraging birds), we applied 2 different danger zone boundaries, at 40 m and 500 m from shore. Between years, red knots had a much higher chance to move from the dangerous nearshore area to the safe area beyond (71-78% and 26% for 40-m and 500-m danger zone boundary, respectively), than vice versa (4% and 14%). For neither danger zone boundary value did we find differences in annual mortality for individuals using either dangerous or safe zone, so the move away from the shore with age is attributed to individual careers rather than differential mortality.

Group size is determined by the benefits and costs influencing group formation, which also influences whether groups persist or fail. We investigated whether group size is associated with success (individual survival and reproductive output) in the African ice rat Otomys sloggetti robertsi. Ice rats form mixed-sex plural-breeding colonies that trade off the benefits of huddling below-ground against within-colony resource competition above-ground. We measured behavioural correlates of individual success in summer and winter, focusing on energy saving (basking), acquisition (foraging) and use (burrow maintenance, distance travelled for foraging) behav- iours. We predicted that (1) individuals in larger colonies would forage and travel more to find food because of greater within-colony competition for resources; (2) individuals in larger colonies would bask less than individuals in smaller colonies because of the greater energy savings generated from huddling in larger groups; and (3) burrow maintenance would be greater in smaller colonies because of fewer individuals engaging in this task. We showed that colonies succumbed or persisted as a group (i. e. most individuals present or all absent). In particular, in both seasons, individuals in smaller groups (<= 5 individuals) weremore likely to fail, while those in larger groups (>= 12 individuals) were more likely to persist. The persistence of colonies was positively predicted by foraging and negatively by basking. Foraging was greater in larger colonies and burrow maintenance was greater in smaller colonies. While females of larger colonies produced more offspring in total, reproductive output (per capita offspring production) was not correlated with colony size. Individual ice rats in larger colonies accrued fitness benefits, which were predicted, proximally, by greater foraging and possibly energy savings in larger huddling groups. Statement of significance What proximally determines the relationship between group size, individual success and colony persistence? In ice rats, individuals in larger groups persist, which is correlated with more foraging. Larger groups possibly enjoy the benefits of huddling in larger groups, which are re-channelled into energy-intense activities. Groups failed or persisted as a unit.

Although extraction behaviors were present at low rates in infant capuchins' repertoire, we found that the acquisition of adequate detection techniques was fully completed in subadults, aged around 6. Selecting appropriate foraging substrates, requiring accurate assessment of the physical properties of bamboo stalks, gradually increased with age and experience. We showed that both components of searching required extended practice beyond that required to master the handling components.

Whiteside_2016,"Whiteside, Mark A.; Langley, Ellis J. G.; Madden, Joah R.",Males and females differentially adjust vigilance levels as group size increases: effect on optimal group size,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"A strong motivation for one individual to aggregate with others is to reduce their vigilance because other group members provide coverage and warning of approaching predators. This collective vigilance means that a focal individual is usually less susceptible to predation than when alone. However, individuals differ in their vigilance levels depending on status and context. They may also differ in how they adjust their vigilance levels as group size changes. This flexibility in response means that the collective vigilance of a group, and hence its optimal size, is not intuitive. We demonstrate, in both natural and experimental systems, that male and female pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, in harems differentially adjusted their vigilance levels as harem size changed. Females became less vigilant as harems became larger, and benefited by increasing their foraging time. Conversely, males became more vigilant as harems became larger. We calculated the collective probability that a harem would detect a predator. Within natural harem sizes, a male and two females exhibited the highest probability of collective detection, with decreases as more females joined. This optimal harem size matched the average harem size observed at our study site. Females may join harems for benefits of collective vigilance. Despite both sexes having a shared interest in larger harems for mating benefits, optimal harem size is influenced by trade-offs in a nonsexual behaviour, vigilance. This results in males with relatively small harems, females associating with less preferred males and each male being surrounded by fewer females than he could mate with.

I provide an empirical test of these predictions in staging semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) in a system controlling for many confounding factors that have marred earlier research. Controlling for food density, forager density and phenotypic attributes often correlated with distance to cover, I found that as distance to obstructive cover increased, sandpipers foraged in sparser groups, were less flighty and to some extent less vigilant.

Specifically, we investigated the proportion of vigilance, foraging, and social behaviour within a system of urban colonies that varied in area, degree of connectivity, and time since isolation. Overall, rates of vigilance were lower than are typically reported for black-tailed prairie dogs in grassland habitats. Colonies that were more isolated exhibited higher levels of vigilance, but colonies isolated for a longer period of time exhibited reduced vigilance. Thus, while urban stimuli may increase alertness in the most isolated colonies, we suggest that black-tailed prairie dogs might eventually adjust to these stimuli and relax their vigilance responses. Because behaviour varies based on age of fragments, we provide evidence that black-tailed prairie dog populations are responding to urbanization through behavioural changes that may be adaptive.

This question is of theoretical and practical interest, yet few empirical data exist to date. We examined how a group of wild chacma baboons travelled among multiple, simultaneously fruiting mountain fig trees (Ficus glumosa). In the course of a 16-month study, this highly preferred fruit was available during a 3-week period, from relatively few sites, which were also utilized by four larger baboon groups. We used directness of route and travel speed of 13 days of observation, and approach rates of 31 days of observation to differentiate between purposeful and opportunistic encounters with 50 fig trees. The study group visited a total of 30 fig trees overall, but only 8 trees per day on average. Each morning, they travelled along a highly repetitive route on all days of observation, thereby visiting 2-4 fig trees. They approached these trees rapidly along highly directed paths without intermittently exploiting other food sources that were available in large quantities. Then, they abruptly changed behaviour, switching to lower travel speed and less directed routes as they foraged on a variety of foods. They approached additional fig trees later in the day, but approach rates were similar to those at times of year when fruit of this fig species was unavailable; this suggested that encounters with trees after the behavioural switch were not planned. Comparing visits to purposefully and opportunistically encountered trees, we found no difference in the average time spent feeding or frequency of feeding supplants, suggesting that purposefully and opportunistically visited trees had similar values. We conclude that when foraging for mountain fig fruit the baboons' cognitive maps either contain information on relatively few trees or of only a single route along which several trees are situated, leading to very limited planning abilities.",2010,10.1007/s10071-009-0254-8,yes,ethology,obs,Papio_ursinus,primate,mammal,direct_obs,25,13.5,0.19,,42,ABC,yes,ethogram,"ethogram, social, movement","sixteen month study, but the fig fruiting season is three weeks - 480 days, or 42 days?",

Our study was conducted in Eastern Ladakh (India), during summer and fall. Our results showed that groups were highly synchronized, and that individuals in groups were particularly synchronized when feeding.

Males in groups, however, spent less time feeding than solitary males, and females in groups with foals spent less time feeding and more time standing than females in groups without foals.

Analysis of time budgets of male takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in Sichuan, China",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,"Mammals maximize fitness by optimizing time and energy allocation between reproduction and survival. Describing time budgets is a way to understand a species' constraints in energy allocation. We describe a time budget for male takin (Budorcas taxi color) in Tangjiahe Nature Reserve, China, to better understand rut-induced hypophagia, which is frequently observed in temperate ungulates that breed in autumn or in winter. Observations generally occurred at two elevations (1200-1600 m and 2600-3200 m). using 20-min focal animal scan sampling from 2007 to 2009. Feeding behaviors accounted for the majority in takin's time budget (61.1%) during daylight hours, relative to the other observed behaviors, such as rest (14.1%), alert behavior (10.2%) and locomotion (6.8%). We found a negative correlation between feeding behavior and rutting behavior during the rutting season. A ratio of feeding time to resting time increased from pre-rut to rut, while resting behavior did not change significantly across seasons. These results suggest the energy saving hypothesis could explain reduced foraging in male takin during the rut, but aspects of the species biology suggest that hypotheses for rut-induced hypophagia developed for other temperate ungulates do not apply to takin. We suggest that the unusual summer rutting season of takin releases males from the energy constraints encountered by temperate ungulates that breed in the autumn and has other benefits for offspring survival. Further research should be conducted on ungulates that exhibit rut during the summer and tropical ungulates that might not experience limited food availability following the mating season to improve our understanding on rut-induced hypophagia.

Walsh_2013,"Walsh, Patrick T.; McCreless, Erin; Pedersen, Amy B.",Faecal avoidance and selective foraging: do wild mice have the luxury to avoid faeces?,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Hosteparasite interactions are a key determinant of the population dynamics of wild animals, and behaviours that reduce parasite transmission and infection may be important for improving host fitness. While antiparasite behaviours have been demonstrated in laboratory animals and domesticated ungulates, whether these behaviours operate in the wild is poorly understood. Therefore, examining antiparasite behaviours in natural populations is crucial for understanding their ecological significance. In this study, we examined whether two wild rodents (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, and deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus), selectively foraged away from conspecific faeces or avoided faeces altogether, and whether faecal gastrointestinal parasite status affected their behaviour. We also tested whether wild mice, when nesting, avoided using material that had previously been used by healthy or parasite-infected conspecifics. Our results, in contrast to laboratory mouse studies, suggest that wild mice do not demonstrate faecal avoidance, selective foraging or selective use of nesting material; they preferred being near faeces and did not differentiate between faeces from parasitized and uninfected conspecifics. Behavioural avoidance to reduce parasite infection may still represent an important strategy; however, mice in our study population appeared to favour the opportunity to feed and nest over the risks of coming into contact with faecal-transmitted parasites. Furthermore, the presence of conspecific faeces may actually provide a positive cue of a good foraging or nesting location. Ultimately, balancing the trade-off of performing antiparasite behaviours to reduce infection with missing an important feeding or nesting opportunity may be very different for animals in the wild facing complex and stochastic environments.

We used droppings and video recordings to compare the diet and foraging behaviour of six shorebird species at Banc d'Arguin: dunlin, sanderling, red knot, ringed plover, grey plover and bar-tailed godwit. In four of those species, the detail achieved in prey identification allowed us to calculate niche width and foraging niche overlap. Sanderling and ringed plover consumed a wide range of macroinvertebrate taxa, while red knot consumed mainly bivalves with some gastropods, and both grey plover and bar-tailed godwit fed mainly on polychaete worms. A large proportion of dunlin droppings had no recognizable food items, suggesting a soft-bodied prey that we could not identify. Dunlin was the only strictly tactile forager, while sanderling and red knot used both visual and tactile methods. The remaining species resort to visual cues for catching prey, even though tactile cues may be important for bar-tailed godwits. Dunlin, sanderling, red knot and ringed plover all showed relatively narrow trophic niches and non-significant levels of foraging niche overlap. Overall, the diet of each shorebird was broadly similar to that reported from other parts of their wintering ranges, with more gastropods in the red knot diet than previously described.

Avoiding feeding in proximity to faeces has been shown to be an antiparasitic strategy in experimental settings with domestic and semidomestic ungulates. However, few studies have tested the faecal avoidance hypothesis in wild herbivores. We tested the faecal avoidance hypothesis in a wild population of Alpine ibex by comparing the quantity of faeces in grazed and avoided areas. We counted faecal pellets within a plot around a grazing individual and a plot around a spot actively avoided by the same individual. As predicted, grazed plots had lower densities of faecal pellets than avoided plots. Fresh faeces were avoided more often than medium-aged and old faeces. We found consistent differences in the level of faecal avoidance among individuals, but this was not related to the level of gastrointestinal parasite infection or to the age of the host. Our results suggest that wild Alpine ibex actively avoid foraging near faeces but the antiparasitic value of this behaviour is not evident. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Echolocation call sequences of bats contain information about the identity and behaviour of the sender which is perceptible to close-by receivers. Increasing evidence supports the communicative function of echolocation within species, yet data about its role for interspecific information transfer is scarce. Here, we asked which information bats extract from heterospecific echolocation calls during foraging. In three linked playback experiments, we tested in the flight room and field if foraging Myotis bats approached the foraging call sequences of conspecifics and four heterospecifics that were similar in acoustic call structure only (acoustic similarity hypothesis), in foraging ecology only (foraging similarity hypothesis), both, or none. Compared to the natural prey capture rate of 1.3 buzzes per minute of bat activity, our playbacks of foraging sequences with 23-40 buzzes/min simulated foraging patches with significantly higher profitability. In the flight room, M. capaccinii only approached call sequences of conspecifics and of the heterospecific M. daubentonii with similar acoustics and foraging ecology. In the field, M. capaccinii and M. daubentonii only showed a weak positive response to those two species. Our results confirm information transfer across species boundaries and highlight the importance of context on the studied behaviour, but cannot resolve whether information transfer in trawling Myotis is based on acoustic similarity only or on a combination of similarity in acoustics and foraging ecology. Animals transfer information, both voluntarily and inadvertently, and within and across species boundaries. In echolocating bats, acoustic call structure and foraging ecology are linked, making echolocation calls a rich source of information about species identity, ecology and activity of the sender, which receivers might exploit to find profitable foraging grounds. We tested in three lab and field experiments if information transfer occurs between bat species and if bats obtain information about ecology from echolocation calls. Myotis capaccinii/daubentonii bats approached call playbacks, but only those from con- and heterospecifics with similar call structure and foraging ecology, confirming interspecific information transfer.

Sodium is essential for nerve function and osmotic balance; however, it can be limiting in some environments, such as those at high elevations. Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) living in subalpine regions have been observed eating Eucalyptus mannifera bark, an unusual food choice for a folivore. We hypothesized that sodium may be deficient in leaves at high-elevation sites, and that the bark from trees could be a potential sodium source. We compared the mineral content of eucalypt bark and leaves in 3 areas where koalas chew bark and in leaves of a preferred food tree of koalas, E. viminalis, across a range of elevations. Individual chewed trees were rare compared to non-chewed conspecifics and patchily distributed. Bark from chewed E. mannifera trees had significantly higher concentrations of sodium than plant parts from non-chewed neighboring conspecifics and other Eucalyptus species trees. We also found that E. viminalis foliage had significantly less sodium at higher elevations than lowland populations.

Within broad distributions, generalists select optimal food sources; however, the availability and representation of selected food items in the diets of generalist consumers vary geographically. Conversely, specialists, within their entire range, concentrate on specific food resources, and their diets remain constant in varying environments. The distributions of highly palatable food resources might influence the foraging patterns of species with opportunistic foraging behaviours. We used the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) as a model for what is considered an opportunistic generalist herbivore. We analysed whether the beavers' foraging pattern could show specialisation. Five beaver populations living in diverse environments were evaluated, and their diet choices for overwintering were examined. Our data indicated low proportions of generality with regard to the beavers' foraging behaviours. Within 110 territories, we observed that beavers did pursue choosy opportunistic strategies, though only to a small extent. Although we confirmed the established knowledge that beavers prefer to browse mainly poplars and willows, we also found that, contrary to many published studies, their preferences occurred regardless of riparian vegetation composition. While the beavers examined in this study preferred six genera of woody vegetation, we argue that they may have been inclined primarily to use two genera with regard to both food choice and spatial territory placement.

PPC may arise from physiological constraints to gut capacity or digestive rate. Alternatively, PPC may represent an optimal foraging strategy. Assessments that clearly distinguish between these causes are rare and have been conducted only for invertebrate species that are ambush predators with extra-intestinal digestion (e. g., wolf spiders). We present the first strong test for the cause of PPC in a cursorial vertebrate predator with intestinal digestion: wolves (Canis lupus) feeding on moose (Alces alces). Previous theoretical assessments indicate that if PPC represents an optimal foraging strategy and is not caused by physiological limitations, then mean carcass utilization is negatively correlated with mean kill rate and the utilization of individual carcasses is uncorrelated with time between kills. Wolves exhibit exactly this pattern. We explore how the typical portrayal of PPC by wolves has been not only misleading but also detrimental to conservation by promoting negative attitudes toward wolves.",2012,10.1007/s00265-011-1277-0,yes,ethology,obs,Canis_lupus,carnivore,mammal,"feeding_evidence, tracking",293,544,,1,616,A,no,n/a,"feeding_evidence, kill_site_analysis, predator_prey",,

Most cones were only partly eaten and some mature seeds remained in the distal part. This was in contrast to years of lower seed production when nearly all seeds were harvested from the majority of cones. To determine whether nutcracker cone-discarding behaviour maximised intake rate, seed kernels and the aborted seeds rate were measured from the different cone parts. In 2009, seeds from cone-tops were on average 17% lighter than in the base and middle sections, and the proportion of aborted seeds in the top part was 81% higher than in the other sections. There was no difference in seed mass and proportion of aborted seeds in cone-tops of intact cones and cones handled by nutcrackers.

As predicted, swans situated farther from water exhibited longer FIDs compared with those closer to the shore. In addition, there was the possibility of an interesting interaction effect (p<0.061) of sex and direction of approach on FID. Whilst males tended to not alter their response in relation to the angle of approach relative to the water, females tended to respond at longer distances, when approached from the shore than when approached from the land or parallel to the shore.

This prediction has been verified for many risk factors and prey species. The same predictions may apply to other aspects of escape, but testing has been much less extensive. For the lizards Callisaurus draconoides and Sceloporus magister, we tested several such predictions and examined the effect of a previously unstudied risk factor, recent movement by prey. Starting distance (predator-prey distance when approach begins) was unrelated to FID in C. draconoides, as in previously studied ambush foragers. Because movement increases probability of being detected, we predicted that FID would be greater for prey that had moved immediately before being approached than those that had been immobile. FID and distance fled (DF) were longer for lizards that had moved recently. In C. draconoides DF and probability of entering refuge were greater for the second of two approaches, as predicted from greater threat posed by a persistent predator. Callisaurus draconoides had shorter FID and shorter DF, and fewer entered refuge where lizards were habituated than unhabituated to human presence. In S. magister FID increased as distance to refuge increased, FID and DF were longer for fast than slow approaches; probability of fleeing and FID were larger for direct than indirect approach. Effects of these risk factors on FID are consistent across studies, but approach speed has affected DF in only half of studies, perhaps due to constraints by refuge entry and variable distance to refuge. Similarities in effects of risk factors across escape variables, types of predator-prey encounters, and latency to emerge from refuge suggest that similar risk assessment mechanism are used for all variables and settings.",2013,10.1163/1568539X-00003061,yes,ethology,exp,"Callisaurus_draconoides, Sceloporus_magister",lizard,reptile,direct_obs,126,0.1,,1,15,B,no,vigilance,"FID, predator_simulation","no indiv ID, n = number of trials conducted (no mention of how long each one lasted)",

Lama guanicoe (guanaco) is a social native herbivore in South America and a social species. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antipredator responses of different-sized groups of guanacos in areas with varying predation risks and to determine antipredator mechanisms in guanacos. For this, we measured different antipredator responses to a potential predator (human subjects). Detection of predator and flight distances from predator both increased with a greater number of guanacos per group and with greater distances among guanacos within the social group. Both buffer distance and flight time decreased with a greater number of guanacos per group, but increased with greater distances among guanacos inside the social group. Solitary adult males moved shorter distance and mixed groups moved greater distances. Flight distances were greater in areas with tall and dense vegetation than in areas with low vegetation. Buffer distance and flight time were shorter in undulating land than on flat lands, and groups were usually observed on hill slopes. Our results suggest that the benefit of social grouping in guanacos is the increased probability of avoiding predator with cooperative vigilance and not with the dilution effect. This means that a predator could be detected earlier when approaching a guanaco group than when approaching a solitary individuals and could thus be avoided. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Camacho_2014,"Camacho, Carlos",'Bodyguard' plants: Predator-escape performance influences microhabitat choice by nightjars,BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,"Prey are typically assumed to avoid their predators. However, habitat selection patterns of prey might depend upon their ability to use particular landscape elements to manage their escape options from predator encounters. During two breeding seasons, I studied habitat use and behaviour of red-necked nightjars (Caprimulgus ruficollis) foraging under the risk of predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in southwestern Spain. Nightjars exhibited nearly invariable foraging site choice and body positioning behaviour based on the architecture of vegetation near foraging sites. Nightjars actively chose to sit <50 cm from >120 cm-tall shrubs or trees while facing away from vegetation cover. Vegetation behind nightjars significantly increased their aerial escape opportunities from terrestrial attacks during their peak activity period, when nightjars reveal visible feather bands during their foraging sallies from the ground and their cryptic colouration may not always match the background. Spatial overlap of nightjars and foxes along roads suggests that microhabitat selection by these birds may in part depend on the chance of escape from predator encounters rather than on the probability of encountering predators. I conclude that the interplay between high escape efficiency and visibility have probably contributed to the evolution of foraging site selection by caprimulgids using bare grounds and cattle, horse and camel trails as the natural counterpart of roads.

We think the main reason is lack of theory and testable predictions.Few studies have reported flight responses of prey on landscape slopes in the wild, and little theoretical work is available. We present a formal model to predict whether prey should move up or down the hillside after detecting a perched raptor as determined by the duration of the attack once launched by the predator, perching height of the predator, and the landscape slope. We recorded escape responses of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major when approached by a human in the field. This was done in the postfledging period, when the demand for food is high, and when the families usually move to a new site, presumably perceived to be safer, to continue foraging after being exposed to a predator. We found that great tit families, which prefer to forage close to the ground, flew uphill, matching the model's prediction. However, blue tit families, which forage higher in the canopy, did not move uphill but moved higher up in the trees.

To exploit resources in heterogeneous landscapes optimally, foragers should intensively search in profitable patches while minimizing foraging activities in low-quality areas. We used first-passage time (FPT) analysis to identify and characterize area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour along the nightly movement paths of racoons. While FPT analysis has been successfully applied to a variety of pelagic species, our goal was to determine the ability of FPT to detect habitat characteristics associated with changes in searching behaviour for a terrestrial predator. Racoons, Procyon lotor, were tracked via radiotelemetry during their nightly movements. We found evidence of ARS behaviour in 55 of 58 paths, with racoons concentrating intensive searching bouts in areas with an average radius of 42.6 m (range 20-100 m). To test whether our detection of ARS represented an actual change in behaviour, we tracked five racoons in relation to an artificial food patch. We detected ARS behaviour during 9 of 10 occasions in which a tracked animal encountered the food patch. Racoons showed ARS behaviour in areas with abundant shallow water, and they moved quickly through openings and dry areas with sparse ground-level vegetation. Application of this method should prove useful for studies of habitat use and foraging ecology of terrestrial predators by providing links between animal movements and the environment.

Young capuchins spend several years interacting with nuts before cracking them efficiently with stone tools. Using a two-observer method, we quantified the magnitude of the social influences that sustain this long period of practice. During five collection periods (over 26 months), one observer recorded the behavior of 16 immature monkeys, and another observer concurrently recorded behavior of group members in the focal monkey's vicinity. The two-observer method provides a means to quantify distinct social influences. Data show that immatures match the behavior of the adults in time and especially in space. The rate of manipulation of nuts by the immatures quadrupled when others in the group cracked and ate nuts, and immatures were ten times more likely to handle nuts and 40 times more likely to strike a nut with a stone when they themselves were near the anvils. Moreover, immature monkeys were three times more likely to be near an anvil when others were cracking. We suggest a model for social influence on nut-cracking development, based on two related processes: (1) social facilitation from observing group members engaged in nut-cracking, and (2) opportunity for practice provided by the anvils, hammer stones and nut shells available on and around the anvils.

While many studies have examined the behavioural responses of endotherms to cold temperatures, thermoregulatory behaviour may also occur in response to heat stress. We evaluated whether a heat-sensitive northern ungulate, the moose, Alces alces, showed thermoregulatory behaviour in response to ambient temperature in two populations in southern Norway. We quantified the seasonal habitat use of GPS-collared adult females, as well as fine-scale habitat selection patterns, in relation to time of day and critical temperature thresholds thought to induce heat stress. We also assessed whether temperature-associated changes in spatial behaviour led to a shift in the availability of thermal cover and forage at the chosen location. Frequent exposure to temperatures above critical thresholds occurred in both summer and winter and in both study areas. Moose responded by seeking thermal shelter in mature coniferous forest and avoiding open habitat types, leading to a decrease in local forage availability in summer but not in winter. Differences in habitat choice in response to temperature were most pronounced at twilight. We found that fine-scale habitat selection analyses, using step-selection functions, more effectively revealed thermoregulatory behaviour in both seasons and populations than did habitat use. This is because habitat selection analyses are better able to identify limiting factors operating at different spatiotemporal scales than is habitat use. Our results clearly show that ambient temperature affected fine-scale behavioural decisions of moose with consequences for forage accessibility, especially during summer. As the climate changes, the limiting effect of ambient temperature (cold and high) on animal behaviour is likely to increase, potentially influencing individual fitness and population dynamics.

However, sharing foraging sites with kin can also have costs if it increases food competition, which is not compensated by direct benefits. The goal of this study was to investigate whether sharing of individual foraging areas in female Bechstein's bats is best explained by kin selection or by direct benefits through social foraging. To assess their individual foraging behaviour, we analysed radio-tracking data of 22 members of one maternity colony, including nine mother-daughter pairs, seven pairs of less closely related individuals and six pairs of unrelated bats. We examined the bats' fidelity to specific foraging areas during several years and quantified the influence of kinship on the overlap among individual foraging areas. By measuring how close to each other the bats foraged, we assessed whether individuals with overlapping areas are likely to forage together. Our study confirms previous findings that Bechstein's bats show high fidelity to foraging areas across years. Moreover, we found that relatives share foraging areas significantly more often compared with unrelated colony members. Finally, our data reveal for the first time that most colony members that share foraging areas are unlikely to forage together. This suggests that female Bechstein's bats gain no direct benefits from sharing foraging areas with members of the same maternal lineage. Our findings also have implications for conservation as habitat loss within a colony's home range might expose entire matrilines to high risks.",2013,10.1111/eth.12123,yes,telem,obs,Myotis_bechsteinii,bat,mammal,radio_triang,22,3.008,,164.3636364,350,C,yes,resting,"foraging_area, inferred_foraging",area where bats spent time outside their roost is assumed to be foraging,

Existing studies are based on modest sample sizes because of the rarity of this endangered species and the difficulty of radio-tracking bats. Our objectives were to determine resource selection by foraging Indiana bats during the maternity season and to compare resource use between pregnant and lactating individuals. We used an information theoretic approach with discrete choice modeling based on telemetry data to evaluate our hypotheses that land cover, percent canopy cover, distance to water, and prescribed fire affected the relative probability a point was used by a foraging Indiana bat. We fit models for individual bats and a population-level model based on all individuals with a random factor to account for differences in sample size among individuals. We radio-tracked 29 individuals and found variation in resource selection among individuals. However, among individuals with the same supported covariates, the magnitude and direction of the covariates were similar. Eighteen bats selected areas with greater canopy closure and 5 of 6 bats that had areas burned by low-intensity prescribed fire in their home range selected burned areas. Resource selection was related to land cover for 13 individuals; they selected forest and shrubland over agricultural land, which composed >50% of the landscape within 10km. We found no support for our hypothesis that resource selection was related to individual reproductive condition or Julian date in our population-level model indicating habitat selection was not determined by reproductive status or date within the maternity season. Land use or forest management that greatly reduces canopy cover may have a negative impact on Indiana bat use. Maintaining forest cover in agricultural landscapes is likely critical to persistence of maternity colonies in these landscapes. Sites managed with low severity prescribed fire may be selected by some individuals because of reduced understory vegetation.

Day roosts and foraging areas of radio-tracked animals were recorded during late spring, early summer, and late summer. Home ranges were calculated for each sex based on identified locations. Distance analysis between sex-specific roosts and foraging areas was conducted for each period. Mixed colonies were confirmed by trapping at roosts. Home range of males was larger (47.3 km(2)) than of females (9.7 km(2)). During late spring, distances between male and female roosts were larger (median = 715 m) than during early (median = 474 m) and late summer (median = 489 m).

However, some tropical plants are evolved with sharp spines to avoid herbivores and/or to prevent water loss, which makes foraging by frugivores difficult. Such plants receive frugivores' attention, either because of resource scarcity or adaptive behavioural plasticity. We have a limited understanding of how fruit-eating animals access fruits protected by spines. In this 1-year study, we describe bat foraging on a spiny tropical shrub, Ziziphus mauritiana (Rhamnaceae) whose dried branches are often used by the local people to capture bats in caves that inevitably damage their wing membranes. The greater short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx was the only visitor to this spiny plant during its fruiting season and predominantly extracted fruits using a hovering tactic (on 81% observations) without damaging wing membranes. The hovering enabled them to extract fruits quicker than when alighting on the tree. Bats carried all the fruits away from the parent tree to feeding roosts for consumption. Bat foraging has thus effectuated short-distance seed dispersal (range 11-70 m radii) in which most seeds (30.73%) were found at the distance of 31-40 m in our search up to 150 m. Although bats extracted both ripe and unripe fruits, ripe-fruit extraction was 4.5 x higher than the unripe fruits. This study shows the tradeoff between getting a good meal and contending with spines in a resource-scarce habitat. Besides, this study describes the adaptive foraging tactics of greater short-nosed fruit bats that facilitate short-distance seed dispersal.",2021,10.1007/s10164-021-00711-4,yes,ethology,obs,Cynopterus_sphinx,bat,mammal,direct_obs,n/a,n/a,12.83333333,,60,A,no,n/a,"foraging_mode, fixed_obs_point","watched trees and waited for bats to appear, didn't follow individuals or investigate other behaviour",

For example, sex differences in preferred foraging techniques used by green woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, have previously been explained by sexual dimorphism in bill length and the benefits afforded by foraging specialization and niche differentiation within cooperative groups. Contrary to this argument, there were no sex differences in mean foraging success and/or prey size captured when males and females used the same foraging techniques. Subordinates of both sexes did experience lower and more varied foraging success compared with dominants, but probably only as a consequence of competition or inexperience. However, dominant males experienced greater variance in individual foraging success compared with dominant females, and dominant males also experienced greater variances in prey size when using their preferred foraging techniques. Dominant males therefore appeared to specialize in foraging techniques that provided more variable rewards, whilst dominant females consistently chose to minimize variation in reward. Dominant females also experienced less variance in foraging returns when using the same techniques as males, suggesting a possible link with sexual dimorphism in bill length. Partitioning of foraging niches in dominant green woodhoopoes therefore appears to be better explained by sex differences in variance (risk) sensitivity to foraging rewards. We suggest that this kind of detailed analysis of state-dependent foraging has the potential to explain many of the crucial age and sex differences in behaviour within cooperative groups.",2010,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01811.x,yes,ethology,obs,Phoeniculus_purpureus,passerine,bird,direct_obs,55,n/a,0.008399832,,240,AB,yes,ethogram,"foraging_success, sex_differences, niche_differentiation",,

Foraging behavior and foraging success of the Reddish Egret were studied by focusing on whether their foraging behavior or success varied with age, color morph, group size, and habitat measures. Foraging individuals (n = 372) were video-recorded in the Laguna Madre of Texas, USA, from March 2008-April 2010. Adult Reddish Egrets were 30-250% more successful foragers than juveniles, and groups were 32-44% more successful foragers than solitary foragers. Foraging success was similar between color morphs. The more specialized foraging behaviors of canopy feeding, wing flicking, and foot-stirring had the highest success, but were employed infrequently. Four environmental variables (wind speed, light intensity, water depth, and percent seagrass coverage) were found to influence foraging success, but accounted for only 3% of the variation in foraging behavior. Our results suggest that environmental variables have little influence on foraging behavior of Reddish Egrets in the Laguna Madre, and we suggest that characteristics of the prey have a stronger influence.

I provide the first examination of skill development from 866 object-manipulation and 7,400 tool-use bouts, collected over 15 months, using longitudinal analyses of infants' object manipulation (N = 7) and cross-sectional comparisons of manipulative and tool-use behavior (N = 69). I adopt a Perception-action approach, examining how the emergence of actions on objects relate to the spatial-relational and percussive challenges of tool use. Infants begin manipulating single items, particularly stones, at 1-2 months. Combining objects predominates (78%) by 1.5-2.5 years, and bouts involving food and tools but with incorrect spatial relations and action sequences prevail (73%) by 2.5-3.5 years. Placing, precedes rubbing objects on surfaces. Percussion emerges last, as disorganized striking before becoming consistent and targeted. Macaques manipulate combinations of stones and oysters, before stones, anvils, and motile shellfish, but success on either food type is only observed at 2.5-3.5 years. After competence, success rates and strike accuracy improve within 3 months on oysters and 5 months on motile shellfish. Older tool users (>4.5 years) had higher success rates, strike accuracy, strike efficiency, and tool fidelity.

Despite much research, we still lack quantified demonstrations of how fruit display traits affect fruit removal behaviour. Although the fruit crop size hypothesis proposes a general mechanism for fruit trait selection, it overlooks the fact that distinctive bird behaviours in a bird assemblage would have different effects on fruit crop size. Here, we show that the relevance of fruit crop size for bird fruit consumption is driven by two basic components of fruit foraging behaviour: fruit handling and residence time. We assessed bird fruit-eating behaviour (fruit consumption, fruit handling and residence time) and its relationship with fruit crop size, taking into account body size and spatial focal context (conspecific neighbour density and distance to the forest edge from individual plants) in a population of Vassobia breviflora (Solanaceae) in Tucuman, Argentina. At the assemblage level, fruit consumption was positively related to fruit crop size and residence time, and the interaction between fruit crop size and residence time depended on fruit-handling behaviour. At the functional group level, both gulpers and pulp consumers showed a positive relationship between fruit consumption and residence time. However, gulpers showed a negative interaction between fruit crop size and residence time, while pulp consumers showed no interaction. At the species level, fruit consumption by Turdus rufiventris (gulper) was positively related to fruit crop size, whereas fruit consumption by Thraupis sayaca and Zonotrichia capensis (pulp consumers) depended positively on residence time. Essentially, gulpers spent short residence times in plants with larger fruit crops, whereas pulp consumers spent long residence times in plants regardless of fruit crop size.

We studied the effect of female group size on three aspects of harem male behavior: social grooming by reciprocal licking, tent maintenance, and tent guarding in the mast tree Polyalthia longifolia. In the process of reciprocal licking, all the bats in the harem were drenched in saliva before emergence, and this activity was positively and significantly correlated with female group size. Once females departed for foraging, harem males remained in their respective tents at night-time between intermittent foraging bouts and engaged in tent maintenance and tent guarding. Time invested by harem male bats in tent maintenance and tent guarding were positively and significantly correlated with female group size. Harem males extended their presence in tent by utilizing tents as feeding roosts. Female group size also influenced the emergence time of harem male bats, where males with largest group emerged later than did the smallest group.

Here, we show that maximum entropy species distribution modeling can be used to successfully predict small-scale variation in the distribution of 24 important plant food species for chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We combined model predictions with behavioral observations to quantify feeding habitat quality as the cumulative dietary proportion of the species predicted to occur in a given location. This measure exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity with elevation and latitude, both within and across main habitat types. We used model results to assess individual variation in habitat selection among adult chimpanzees during a 10-year period, testing predictions about trade-offs between foraging and reproductive effort. We found that nonswollen females selected the highest-quality habitats compared with swollen females or males, in line with predictions based on their energetic needs.

This can be studied in risk perception during movement in relation to specific habitat types, whereby individuals trade-off between foraging and disturbance. Due to its high behavioral plasticity and increasing occurrence in urban environments, wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an excellent model organism to study adjustment to urbanization. With the help of GPS tracking, space use of 11 wild boar from Berlin's metropolitan region was analyzed: we aimed at understanding how animals adjust space use to deal with the landscape of fear in urban areas compared to rural areas. We compared use vs. availability with help of generalized linear mixed models. First, we studied landscape types selected by rural vs. urban wild boar, second, we analyzed distances of wild boar locations to each of the landscape types. Finally, we mapped the resulting habitat selection probability to predict hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts. A higher tolerance to disturbance in urban wild boar was shown by a one third shorter flight distance and by an increased re-use of areas close to the trap. Urban wild boar had a strong preference for natural landscapes such as swamp areas, green areas and deciduous forests, and areas with high primary productivity, as indicated by high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values. The areas selected by urban wild boar were often located closely to roads and houses. The spatial distribution maps show that a large area of Berlin would be suitable for urban wild boar but not their rural conspecifics, with the most likely reason being a different perception of anthropogenic disturbance.

Yet, much of the site-specific information we have about the bears in this relationship comes from observations at a few highly visible but unrepresentative locations and a small number of radio-telemetry studies. Consequently, our understanding of brown bear abundance and behavior at more cryptic locations where they commonly feed on salmon, including small spawning streams, remains limited. We employed a noninvasive genetic approach (barbed wire hair snares) over four summers (2012-2015) to document patterns of brown bear abundance and movement among six spawning streams for sockeye salmon, O.nerka, in southwestern Alaska. The streams were grouped into two trios on opposite sides of Lake Aleknagik. Thus, we predicted that most bears would forage within only one trio during the spawning season because of the energetic costs associated with swimming between them or traveling around the lake and show fidelity to particular trios across years because of the benefits of familiarity with local salmon dynamics and stream characteristics. Huggins closed-capture models based on encounter histories from genotyped hair samples revealed that as many as 41 individuals visited single streams during the annual 6-week sampling season. Bears also moved freely among trios of streams but rarely moved between these putative foraging neighborhoods, either during or between years. By implication, even small salmon spawning streams can serve as important resources for brown bears, and consistent use of stream neighborhoods by certain bears may play an important role in spatially structuring coastal bear populations.

J.","Food supplementation affects the foraging ecology of a low-energy, ambush-foraging snake",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"The effect of food availability on the spatial ecology of animals varies within and across study systems because a multitude of factors can affect the spatial activity of organisms. Low-energy specialists, such as ambush-foraging snakes, feed infrequently and can endure long periods without food. Because they have low-energy requirements, one possible tactic for feeding may be to simply ambush for longer periods when prey availability is low, thereby decreasing the potential costs associated with locating new ambush sites. We used radiotelemetry, supplemental feeding, and remote video cameras on free-ranging male puff adders (Bitis arietans) in South Africa to test the hypothesis that food intake affects the foraging ecology of extreme low-energy, ambush foragers and to quantify their natural feeding rates. Supplementally fed puff adders improved their body condition, spent less time foraging, and decreased distance traveled compared to control snakes. However, movement frequency and home range size did not differ between the two groups. These findings indicate that control snakes traveled farther within similar-sized home ranges compared to fed snakes and did so at no survival cost. Further, naturally foraging puff adders successfully caught a prey of small size once every 10 days on average. Hence, despite their sit-and-wait foraging strategy and their low-energy intake/requirements, underfed puff adders travel widely to presumably find appropriate ambush sites that maximize prey capture. Our research provides the first strong evidence that the spatial activity of a terrestrial vertebrate species with extremely low energetic demands is significantly affected by food intake. Significance statement Because animals travel their home range partly to forage, their space use can be affected by the amount of food available in nature. We show that, despite a low-energy lifestyle, the movement level of an ambush-foraging snake that feed infrequently is linked to the amount of food they eat. Underfed snakes traveled greater distances in search of prey, within similar-sized home ranges, compared to well-fed snakes, and they did so at no survival cost. Hence, our research adds to our understanding of the effect of food on the spatial ecology of animals, by providing conclusive evidence that the spatial response of an organism with extremely low-energy demands can be affected by food.",2017,10.1007/s00265-016-2239-3,yes,camer traps_telem,exp,Bitis_arietans,snake,reptile,"radio_tracking, direct_video",36,185,,24.22222222,60,ABC,yes,resting,"habitat_selection, activity_budget","snakes were artificially fed *prior* to observations, but their foraging on this food was not the focus of the study, the satiation effect was",

Prey species can alter their behavior and space use as a response to increased predation risk, which might be traded off with energetic requirements. Thus, whether or not an anti-predator behavior is performed might depend on the perceived risk. In this study, we investigated the behavioral and spatial response of the European hare (Lepus europaeus) toward the presence of a predator scent, using red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scat, an unfamiliar control scent (butyric acid), and a true control (no scent). We collected data on hare activity times and behavior using 50 camera trap locations and spatial data using GPS telemetry (30,481 GPS positions of 12 hares). Hares showed spatial anti-predator behaviors within their home range, for example, the local avoidance of areas treated with scent and remaining further from field edges, in response to sympatric predator scent and partly also in response to unfamiliar butyric acid. Conversely, more costly anti-predator behaviors, that is, increased vigilance at the expense of foraging, were only shown in response to the predator scent. Our results suggest that prey species respond flexibly toward scent cues, utilizing less costly anti-predator behaviors independent of the perceived threat, whereas costly anti-predator responses are only used in the presence of real threat.

Mechanisms that affect the spatial distribution of animals are typically scale-dependent and may involve forage distribution. Forage quality and quantity are often inversely correlated and a much discussed trade-off is whether or not to select for high-quality forage at the expense of forage abundance. This discussion has rarely involved scale-dependence or been applied to Northern browsing herbivores. At small spatial scales, browsers are assumed to select for the best quality forage. But, as high-quality forage resources are often scarce and may become depleted, coarse-scale habitat selection is assumed to be driven by forage availability. 2. To evaluate if moose selection for forage quantity and quality is scale-dependent we modelled summer and winter habitat selection of 32 GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) at two spatial scales (landscape-scale vs. within-home range-scale). We used mixed-effects resource selection functions (RSFs) and landscape-scale forage availability models of six tree species of varying quality for moose. We considered silver birch (Betula pendula), downy birch (Betula pubescens.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as low quality browse species and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), aspen (Populus tremula), willow (Salix spp.) as high-quality species. 3. As expected, the overall selection patterns for available browse biomass and quality varied across spatiotemporal scales. At the landscape-scale, moose selected for habitat with high available browse biomass of low quality species while at the within-home range-scale moose selected for sites with the highest quality browse species available. Furthermore, selection patterns during summer remained fairly stable, while during winter, selection at the within-home range-scale switched from sites with high quality to sites with lower quality browse species which suggests depletion of high-quality species. Consistent with expectations from seasonal resource depletion, site fidelity (bimonthly home range overlap) was much lower in winter than in summer. 4. Coarse-scale habitat selection by moose as a function of forage variability revealed a scale-dependent trade-off between available browse quantity and browse quality. Moreover, resource depletion changed the winter selection criteria of free-ranging moose and we demonstrate how the behavioural response to such a dynamic process can be inferred from RSFs.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01701.x,yes,remote,obs,Alces_alces,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, axy, RSF",32,1733,91.5,,183,BC,yes,resting,"habitat_selection, activity_logger","collars had 2D position sensor that counted head movements - not a proper axy, but close",

First, we investigated how landscape-scale choices made by roe deer fawns and their mothers affected predation risk by red foxes in a forest-farmland mosaic in southeastern Norway. After, we examined the effect of site-specific characteristics and behaviour (i.e. visibility, mother-fawn distance and abundance of the predator's main prey item-small rodents) on predation risk. The study of habitat use, selection and habitat-specific mortality revealed that roe deer utilised the landscape matrix in a functional way, with different habitats used for feeding, providing maternal care and as refugia from predation. Mothers faced a trade-off between foraging and offspring survival. At the landscape-scale decisions were primarily determined by maternal energetic constraints and only secondarily by risk avoidance. Indeed, forage-rich habitats were strongly selected notwithstanding the exceptionally high densities of rodents which increased fawn predation. At fine spatial scales, a high visibility of the mother was the major factor determining predation risk; however, mothers adjusted their behaviour to the level of risk at the bed site to minimise predation. Fawns selected both landscape-scale refugia and concealed bed sites, but failure to segregate from the main prey of red foxes led to higher predation.

Burrow fidelity was variable (mean 27 days; range 0-108) and coincided with reduction in body temperatures, suggesting the onset of torpor. Despite lengthy use of the same burrow, badgers emerged frequently and conducted excursions that appeared to represent foraging behavior. Burrow emergence was not related to ambient temperature or snow depth; rather, it was best explained by the amount of days elapsed since the start of winter.

Hatch-year birds spent significantly more time at landfills than expected based on landfill area relative to the study area outside of landfills.

There was spatial variation in landfill use, with 10% of the landfills used by study birds receiving 75% of the total landfill use. Landfills within two km of communal roosts received significantly more eagle activity than landfills farther from communal roosting sites.

Although direct killing of leopards by lions has been recorded, avoidance behaviour is an important part of leopard ecology that is difficult to measure through direct observation. Using tracking data from simultaneously collared lions and leopards, we investigated the effect of lion proximity on the behavioural ecology of leopards. We show that proximity to lions influenced leopard habitat use, transition probability and behaviour. Within enclosed habitats, lions were allowed to get closer to leopards before leopards engaged in a flight response. Visual observation data suggest that lions and leopards infrequently come into direct contact. However, tracking data indicate that avoidance was based on relative habitat cover and detectability, and as a result the two species were often located within close proximity. Finding new signals of interaction and avoidance within two well-studied predators with relatively small sample sizes suggests that this approach may have value to other systems, such as predator/prey interactions, or relationships between sympatric species, and at a scale hitherto not possible. This could be used to investigate the costs and benefits of animal foraging where competitive exclusion may occur, and is relevant for the large number of animals that are difficult to observe.

We recorded 162 individuals and determined 141 by gender: the sex ratio was 1.07. There was no significant male bias (n = 141, p = 0.210). Habitat selection results indicated that Mandarin duck tended to choose habitat with vegetation cover (2.40 +/- 0.84) on riverbanks, with shoal proportions of 8.00 +/- 6.00%, water velocity of 0.16 +/- 0.12m/s and wider river widths of 190.90 +/- 113.80 m.

While the African buffalo (Syncerus coffer) is sometimes considered a bulk grazer, other studies indicate that they can be selective and show seasonal variations in their home ranges. We used very high resolution satellite imagery to evaluate how the quality and quantity of the vegetation influence space use by buffalo herds in Kruger National Park, testing the bulk-selective hypotheses. Using telemetry data from six buffalo, we analyzed seasonal differences in home ranges and core areas. We investigated resource selection and preference at various spatial scales for a subset of three buffalo, comparing habitat use against vegetation biomass and nitrogen content, derived from a high resolution RapidEye image of the wet season. Overall buffalo preferred open vegetation types, with sparse trees and fertile soils, and had home ranges that partially overlapped between dry and wet seasons (average overlap 50%). Buffalo formed home ranges non-randomly within the study area, choosing vegetation of higher quality and quantity. Within home ranges, however, they selected for higher quality forage, and not for higher quantity. Our results showed that the dichotomy between unselective bulk grazers or selective feeders can be scale dependent, as buffalo behaved more like bulk feeders at the scale of home ranges but were more selective within their home range, preferring quality over quantity.

Theory predicts that spatial and temporal scales should co-vary in most ecological processes and that the most limiting factors should drive habitat selection at coarse ecological scales, but be less influential at finer scales. Using detailed location data on roe deer Capreolus capreolus inhabiting the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, we investigated habitat selection at several spatial and temporal scales. We tested 1) whether time-varying patterns were governed by factors reported as having the largest effects on fitness, 2) whether the trade-off between forage and predation risks differed among spatial and temporal scales and 3) if spatial and temporal scales are positively associated. We analysed the variation in habitat selection within the landscape and within home ranges at monthly intervals, with respect to land-cover type and proxys of food and cover over seasonal and diurnal temporal scales. The fine-scale temporal variation follows a nycthemeral cycle linked to diurnal variation in human disturbance. The large-scale variation matches seasonal plant phenology, suggesting food resources being a greater limiting factor than lynx predation risk. The trade-off between selection for food and cover was similar on seasonal and diurnal scale. Habitat selection at the different scales may be the consequence of the temporal variation and predictability of the limiting factors as much as its association with fitness. The landscape of fear might have less importance at the studied scale of habitat selection than generally accepted because of the predator hunting strategy. Finally, seasonal variation in habitat selection was similar at the large and small spatial scales, which may arise because of the marked philopatry of roe deer.

Using the boreal caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou - grey wolf Canis lupus - black bear Ursus americanus system in eastern Canada, we investigated whether responses of prey towards one predator could concomitantly increase risk of predation from another predator exhibiting a different foraging tactic. We investigated trade-offs made by solitary caribou females and mothers accompanied by their calf during the period of highest calf vulnerability and compared the behaviour of mothers that would eventually lose their calf to predation to that of mothers whose calf survived until the following year. We modelled habitat selection using different metrics of forage based on field measurements and digital maps and developed empirical models of predation risk and prey behaviour using GPS data collected on both predators and prey. Mothers accompanied by their calf seemed to compromise foraging opportunities for safety, as opposed to solitary females who showed no particular avoidance of areas used by predators. Although caribou mothers adopted selection strategies that could have protected their offspring from wolves, females that eventually lost their calf to predation selected for vegetative associations that were favourable to bears.Synthesis and applications. We determined that mothers that most strongly avoided suitable wolf habitat were also those that most strongly selected suitable bear habitat, suggesting that by using antipredator strategies aimed at reducing predation risk from wolves, caribou exposed their offspring to increased predation risk from bears. This result is of paramount conservation value as bears were responsible for 94% of caribou calf kills in this system.

Captive breeding and reintroduction of birds to predator-controlled environments offer a promising means for species recovery. However, these actions pose challenges to a founder population's ability to become established. This study evaluates home range attributes and roosting and foraging patterns within Zealandia Ecosanctuary (Wellington) of Pateke (Brown Teal) with the goal of assessing suitability of forested, predator-controlled sanctuaries as future Pateke release sites, a habitat type currently considered as unsuitable to the species or of marginal quality. VHF telemetry and motion-sensing cameras were used to track seven forest-dwelling Pateke ('bush Pateke') and three lake-dwelling Pateke ('lake Pateke'). Lake Pateke home range size (mean = 3.52 ha) was significantly smaller than for bush Pateke (mean = 24.71 ha). Mean roost distance to the nearest lake was significantly shorter for lake Pateke (mean = 3 m) than that of bush Pateke (mean = 643 m). Two estimates of the percentage of lake edge to forest stream foraging distance percentage were significantly greater for lake Pateke (mean = 56.1% or 59.0%) than that of bush Pateke (mean = 5.3% or 5.7%).

Our understanding of the effects of landscape heterogeneity on animal movement is still fairly limited as it requires studying the movement of multiple individuals across a variety of environmental conditions. Gaining deeper understanding of the environmental drivers of movement is a crucial component of predictive models of population spread and habitat selection and may help inform management and conservation.

The dominant habitat is mesic flatwoods, which has abundant forage but has high water tables that might hinder burrowing and nesting. In contrast, Florida scrub assemblages on inland ridges have suitable soils but scarce forage. We used radio telemetry to monitor 22 male and 23 female Gopher Tortoises in mesic flatwoods and scrub habitats of southern Florida. Compared to mesic flatwoods, we predicted larger home ranges and more frequent movement among burrows in scrub because of the scarcity of forage, and we predicted possible shifts in home ranges (e.g., from wetter to drier habitats) in response to seasonal rainfall. We found that home ranges in our study area were larger than is typical for higher-quality habitats (e.g., sandhill) in other parts of the range, but we observed little movement between habitats. Male home ranges and burrow use patterns were similar in flatwoods and scrub, with males making frequent excursions to court females. Females in scrub were sedentary, contradicting our prediction of frequent movement attributable to scarce forage, and we did not observe feeding forays by either sex to adjacent food-rich habitats. Compared to females in scrub, females in flatwoods had larger home ranges, used more burrows, and moved more frequently among them. High levels of movement in flatwoods might have been influenced by the high water table and frequent burrow flooding.

It can be advantageous for an animal to secure access to habitat heterogeneity at a broader scale in order to be able to dynamically adjust finer scale habitat use through time. We tested the hypothesis of a forage-safety trade-off optimization tactic in a hunted red deer (Cervus elaphus) population following a large accidental forest fire. We used telemetry data and fitted resource selection functions at the second- and third-order scales. We then integrated the order-specific probabilities into single, all-in-one multi-level layers that synthetically captured the habitat selection patterns across scales by informing landscape-scale annual habitat selectivity with finer within-home-range seasonal and diel processes. At the landscape scale, red deer anchored their home-range at the interface of the disturbed and undisturbed patches, thereby securing habitat heterogeneity. This consequently enabled them to modulate within-home-range habitat selection depending on the season and the time of the day. In both seasons, red deer consistently used the burnt area for cover more during the day, and foraged in the unburnt forest and open fields at night. Interestingly there were no major seasonal differences in this diel habitat selection patterns. Increased mortality risk during the hunting season did not substantially change their spatial behaviour.

Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

The Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is an introduced herbivore of the savannas and floodplains of northern Australia. Despite the significant environmental damage caused by water buffalo, important cultural and commercial stakeholders request this species is managed rather than eradicated. However, gaps in knowledge of buffalo ecology limit effective policy and planning. Aims. To better understand how buffalo, at current population densities, respond to seasonally changing resources in the two key habitat types that they occupy in northern Australian - upland eucalypt savanna and seasonally inundated floodplain. Methods. Satellite telemetry was used to record the location of a single female buffalo from each of 11 independent clans every hour over a 12-month period. Generalised linear mixed modelling was used to assess the extent to which buffalo movements, activity-space and site revisitation correlated with forage quality (inferred from the normalised difference vegetation index - NDVI) and localised buffalo density. Key results. As the dry season progressed, forage quantity and quality within the activity-space of buffalo clans decreased. In response, buffalo inhabiting floodplain exhibited increased rates of movement and enlarged the size of their activity-space. This resulted in low repeated visitation of foraging areas in the late dry season and NDVI remained relatively high within these areas. In comparison, buffalo in upland savanna maintained similar rates of activity and occupied the same activity-space size throughout the year. This resulted in frequent revisitation of the same areas in the late dry season and NDVI reached as low as zero in these foraging areas. Clan size and localised buffalo density had no significant effect on measured movement parameters. Conclusions. Buffalo exhibited a behavioural strategy in upland savanna that resulted in acute removal of green herbaceous vegetation within a few kilometres of the clan's permanent water source. Buffalo inhabiting the floodplain used multiple wallows that reduced grazing impacts, but likely resulted in hoof-derived impacts over a broad area. Implications. Current buffalo densities in Kakadu National Park appear to be well below carrying capacity but localised environmental degradation around permanent water sources remains severe in upland savanna.",2021,10.1071/WR20070,yes,telem,obs,Bubalus_bubalis,ungulate,mammal,GPS,11,11435,,8453,365,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, inferred_foraging",,

Consequently, understanding how patterns of behaviour change as landscapes are altered through time may provide important insights into mechanisms underlying observed demographic trends in populations of mule deer. We examined resource selection in relation to habitat change by mule deer on the Tex Creek winter range in southeastern Idaho, USA. We created a GIS-based map of habitats available to mule deer during two time periods, past (1985-1986) and current (2007-2009), to document changes in habitat over time. We then modeled past and current patterns of resource selection by mule deer based on locations obtained from visual observation, radio-telemetry and GPS collars. Abundance and distribution of juniper Juniperus spp., aspen Popuhts tremuloides, sagebrush steppe Artemisia spp. and riparian habitat did not change significantly between past and current time periods. In contrast, we documented an increase in grassland from 3.5 to 30.7% of our study area, and a corresponding decrease in agricultural land, which provides high-quality forage for mule deer, from 37.8 to 12.5% of our study area. Patterns of resource selection largely were similar between the two time periods. Nevertheless, mule deer significantly increased selection of agricultural fields and areas far from roads between the 1980s and 2007-2009. In addition, juniper stands were strongly selected in all years, and importance values (use x availability resealed to 100%) for grassland and sagebrush steppe increased between past and current time periods. Our results indicated that mule deer responded behaviourally to declining availability of high-quality forage (i.e. agricultural land) by increasing selection of agricultural fields. Such functional responses in habitat selection may have important consequences for dynamics of mule deer populations, but additional research is necessary to link those responses to demography and population performance. Although juniper encroachment often is thought to have affected mule deer negatively on many summer ranges, strong selection for juniper in our study highlights the potential importance of that species on winter range, likely because it provides both thermal and hiding cover.",2012,10.2981/11-048,yes,remote,obs,Odocoileus_hemionus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, RSF",51,19,,688.1960784,330,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, inferred_foraging",,

We evaluated the habitat use of female greater prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) to assess the potential for trade-offs between thermal conditions and food resources during the habitat selection process. Our objectives were to 1) compare near-ground temperatures, invertebrate availability, and vegetation characteristics at sites used by greater prairie chickens to conditions at random landscape locations in various time since fire patches and 2) assess changes in conditions at used sites throughout the day to determine if selection for resources changes relative to ambient conditions, resulting in trade-offs between foraging sites and thermal refuge. We found that greater prairie chickens primarily used patches 0-12 months postfire that had relatively high abundances and biomasses of invertebrates compared to other time since fire patches. Greater prairie chickens further modified their selection at relatively fine spatial scales within these food-rich patches to select for areas with cooler temperatures during the hottest part of the day. The use of thermal refuge did not appear to influence the access to food resources as invertebrate abundance and biomass at used sites were consistent throughout the day.

To investigate the seasonal use of Arctic ground squirrels by brown bears, we used resource selection function analysis to describe habitat use, stable isotope analysis to determine individual trophic level and examine its relationship with habitat use, and GPS satellite telemetry to facilitate site investigations.

Managers require better information about starling movement and habit-use patterns to effectively manage starling populations and the damage they cause. Thus, we revisited 6 radio-telemetry studies conducted during fall or winter between 2005 and 2010 to compare starling movements (n = 63 birds) and habitat use in 3 landscapes. Switching of roosting and foraging sites in habitat-sparse rural landscapes caused daytime (0900-1500 hours) radio fixes to be on average 2.6 to 6.3 times further from capture sites than either urban or exurban landscapes (P < 0.001). Roosts in urban city centers were smaller (<30,000 birds, minor roosts) than major roosts (>100,000 birds) 6-13 km away in industrial zones. Radio-tagged birds from city-center roosts occasionally switched to the outlying major roosts. A multitrack railroad overpass and a treed buffer zone were used as major roosts in urban landscapes. Birds traveling to roosts from primary foraging sites in exurban and rural landscapes would often pass over closer-lying minor roosts to reach major roosts in stands of emergent vegetation in large wetlands.

Our objective was to determine the variables influencing movement of a large ungulate, the moose Alces alces, ranging across a boreal landscape, and to link movement behaviour with limiting factors at a fine scale. We assessed 7 candidate models composed of vegetation, solar energy, and topography variables using step selection functions (SSF) for male and female moose across daily and annual periods. We selected and weighted models using the Bayesian Information Criterion. Variables influencing small-scale movements of moose differed among periods and between sexes, likely in response to corresponding changes in the importance of limiting factors. Best models often combined many types of variables, although simpler models composed of only vegetation or topography variables explained male's movements during rut and early winter. Moose steps were observed in good feeding stands from summer to early winter for females and from spring to early winter for males, supporting other studies of moose habitat selection. From summer to early winter, females alternatively selected and avoided cover stands during day and night, respectively. Solar energy reaching the ground was important, particularly during late winter and spring, likely due to its effect on snow cover, air temperature, or plant phenology. Moose generally moved in gentle slopes and variable elevation, which may have increased their chances of finding high quality forage, or improved their search of suitable calving sites or mates.

M.; Rus, Adrian I.; Banks, Peter B.; McArthur, Clare",Space use by animals on the urban fringe: interactive effects of sex and personality,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Personality traits shape individual perceptions of risks and rewards, and so, should affect how animals value and use their environment. Evidence is emerging that personality affects foraging, space use, and exploitation of novel environments such as urban habitat. But the influence of personality is also hypothesized to be sex-dependent when primary motivation for space use differs between sexes, as often occurs in polygynous species. We tested the influence of personality traits, interacting with sex, on space use by the polygynous common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, in an urban-woodland boundary in Sydney, Australia. We quantified personality traits, including exploration, using behavioral assays in an artificial arena. We also GPS-tracked free-ranging individuals, and measured range size, core area: home range, and proportional urban range. We found that personality traits affected space use either as a main effect or, as predicted, an interaction with sex. More exploratory animals, regardless of sex, had higher core area: home range ratios and proportionally larger ranges within urban habitat. However, less exploratory females yet more exploratory males had larger ranges. Our findings provide new insight into movement ecology by demonstrating, for the first time, the sex-dependent influence of personality. The demonstrated influence of personality on urban use by possums also suggests a personality filter for wildlife, as populations transition into urban areas. Finally, as individuals at the interface between urban and natural habitat are also a conduit between the two, a corollary of our findings is that there may be personality-mediated spread of disease across this boundary. Lay Summary: Animal personality traits, such as exploration, quantify consistent behavioral differences among individuals. These traits can influence space use and urban exploitation by individuals, but effects may also differ between the sexes. We found that more exploratory possums on the urban fringe favored urban over woodland habitat. In addition, less exploratory females but more exploratory males had larger ranges; a pattern likely driven by different primary motivators such as food (females) or access to mates (males).",2020,10.1093/beheco/arz194,yes,remote,obs,Trichosurus_vulpecula,marsupial,mammal,GPS,17,1.19,,1132,7,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, inferred_foraging, movement, urban",,

Then, the free distribution model predicts an animal's distribution in a patchy landscape will match the distribution of the resources. If not modified by other factors, such patterns may be expected to be particularly explicit in variable and extreme, forage-limited, and patchy environments, notably alpine and Arctic environments during winter. The large ungulate wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) surviving in such environments is used as a model during the forage-limited winter season. The largest wild reindeer area in Western Europe (Hardangervidda, 8130 km(2)) is actively managed to sustain 10,000-12,000 wild reindeer. Since 2001, 104 different individuals have been GPS-tracked at 3-hr intervals. In winter, mountain reindeer may either choose to seek out and forage in patchy snow-free habitats, typically on top of wind-blown ridges, or use energy-demanding digging through the snow to reach ground forage (cratering). We use late April satellite data from Landsat 5 and 8 (30 x 30 m), airborne laser scanning subsampling (processed to 1 x 1 m grid), and topographic information (1 m resolution) derived from digital aerial photographs (0.25 x 0.25 m resolution) to delineate snow-free patches, constituting less than 694 km(2). By overlaying recorded wild reindeer GPS positions winters 2001-2017 (188,942 positions), we document a strong positive selection for snow-free patches, which were used about four times more frequently than expected from a random walk model. On a daily basis, the preference for snow-free areas was slightly stronger in the evenings. In the sustainable management of wild mountain reindeer, the area of snow-free patches is an important predictor of winter forage availability and important winter source areas.

With anticipated more frequent and extensive future drought, a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that determine large grazer landscape-level distribution under varying climatic conditions is integral to ecosystem management. Using an experimental setting with contrasting fire treatments, we describe the inter-annual variability of the effect of landscape topography and disturbance from prescribed spring fire on large grazer space use in years of variable resource availability. Using GPS telemetry, we investigated space use of plains bison (Bison bison bison) as they moved among watersheds managed with variable experimental burn treatments (1-, 2-, 4-, and 20-year burn intervals) during a seven-year period spanning years of average-to-above average forage production and severe drought. At the landscape scale, bison more strongly favored high-elevation and recently burned watersheds with watersheds burned for the first time in 2 or 4 yr consistently showing higher use relative to annually burned watersheds. In particular, watersheds burned for the first time in 4 yr were avoided to lesser extent than other more frequently burned watersheds during the dormant season. This management type also maintained coupling between bison space use and post-fire regrowth across post-drought growing season months, whereas watersheds with more frequent fire-return intervals attracted bison in only the first month post-fire. Hence, fire frequency played a role in maintaining the coupling of grazer and post-fire regrowth, the fire-grazer interaction, in response to drought-induced reduction in fuel loads. Moreover, bison avoided upland habitat in poor forage production years, when forage regrowth is less likely to occur in upland than in lowland habitats. Such quantified responses of bison to landscape features can aid future conservation management efforts and planning to sustain fire-grazer interactions and resulting spatial heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems.",2017,10.1002/ecs2.1674,yes,remote,obs,Bison_bison,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, RSF",58,9.7,,3876,323,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, inferred_foraging, social, post_fire_response",,

Nipah virus is a zoonotic emerging infectious disease for which pteropodid bats have been identified as a natural reservoir. In Cambodia, Nipah virus circulation has been reported in Pteropus lylei, but little is known about the spatial distribution of the species and the associated implications for conservation and public health. We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 14 P. lylei to study their movements and foraging behavior in Cambodia in 2016. All of the flying foxes were captured from the same roost, and GPS locations were collected for 1 month. The habitats used by each bat were characterized through ground-truthing, and a spatial distribution model was developed of foraging sites. A total of 13,643 valid locations were collected during the study. Our study bats flew approximately 20 km from the roost each night to forage. The maximum distance traveled per night ranged from 6.88-105 km and averaged 28.3 km. Six of the 14 bats visited another roost for at least one night during the study, including one roost located 105 km away. Most foraging locations were in residential areas (53.7%) followed by plantations (26.6%). Our spatial distribution model confirmed that residential areas were the preferred foraging habitat for P. lylei, although our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of individuals studied. Synthesis and applications: Our findings suggest that the use of residential and agricultural habitats by P. lylei may create opportunities for bats to interact with humans and livestock.

Land use planning initiatives seeking to optimize wildlife conservation are hindered by a lack of baseline data quantifying species' tolerance to human-modified landscapes. Objectives We explored the influence of landscape characteristics on the fine-scale space-use patterns of a model generalist carnivore, the Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga), within degraded tropical forests and oil palm plantations. Methods We collected over 20,000 GPS locations from 21 male civets in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo to evaluate the species' space-use patterns and habitat utilization processes. We used movement-based modeling to determine home ranges, and combined the results with high-resolution remotely sensed habitat characteristics. We developed resource utilization functions to determine individual and population-level functional responses to proximity to plantation edge, distance to water, terrain ruggedness, forest structure, and functional diversity. Results Civets foraged within oil palm plantations, yet all animals utilized forests. Home ranges scaled with proportion of plantation within both total and core ranges. Resource utilization functions reported individualism in the species' responses to habitat characteristics. At the population-scale, civets consistently and more intensely used habitats closer to plantation edges and taller tree canopies. Conclusions Although plantations did not pose an inhospitable matrix, oil palm agriculture is a less suitable habitat than remnant forests for civets.

By quantifying microhabitat choice in relation to age or sex, as well as the specific fitness consequences of habitat selection, we can better understand the factors that shape the way organisms distribute themselves across landscapes. Studies of Anolis lizards have provided critical insights into population and community structure, but most studies have focused on interspecific variation in habitat use, rather than intraspecific patterns. We quantified habitat use of Anolis sagrei at two scales (microhabitat and macrohabitat) for males and females of two distinct age classes (juvenile vs adult). We show that age, sex, size, and macrohabitat have significant effects on how A. sagrei utilize available microhabitat and that age, sex, size, and season influence macrohabitat use. In addition, large individuals of both age classes had increased survival during the breeding season. However, body size did not influence overwinter survival, but lizards that used relatively low perches had increased overwinter survival.

The risk of secondary poisoning to native fauna during pest control operations is an issue of global concern. In New Zealand, non-target impacts during sodium fluoroacetate (1080) operations are particularly contentious. 1080 is used extensively for pest control for conservation, bovine tuberculosis control, and in plantation forestry for seedling protection from herbivores. The endemic New Zealand falcon (Falco novaeseelandiae) breeds in Kaingaroa forest, an intensively managed pine plantation where regular 1080 poison operations are conducted; however, causes of mortality and risks of secondary poisoning by 1080 are not well documented. Aims. We aimed to investigate mortality and survival of adult falcons with an emphasis on assessing the possible role of 1080 poisoning in annual mortality. Methods. Using radio-telemetry and visual observations, we monitored 37 marked adult falcons before and after 1080 operations in 2013-14 (16 through carrot-bait and 21 through cereal-bait operations) and assessed mortality causes through post-mortem examinations. Using Program MARK, the annual survival rates for adults and independent juveniles were estimated from long-term banding data (2003-2014). Key results. Survival of falcons was high through both cereal-bait (21/21) and carrot-bait (15/16) 1080 operations (overall 95% CI for survival = 84-100%). The exception was a radio-tagged male that died of unknown causes within a fortnight of an operation and tested negative for 1080 residues. Three falcons were depredated by introduced mammals. One falcon was found dead in an emaciated condition but evidently died from head injury through Australasian magpie (Cracticus tibicen) attack. The annual survival rate of falcons estimated from long-term banding was 80 +/- 6.0% (mean +/- s.e.) for adults and 29 +/- 0.1% for juveniles. Conclusions. No adult falcon death was attributable to 1080 poisoning in this study. Identifiable mortalities were attributable to depredation by introduced mammals and an injury from an Australasian magpie.

In this study we used two methods to investigate the effect of predation risk on habitat use by the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys sp. nov) in Ngel Nyaki forest reserve, Nigeria. The first method was 'giving up density' (GUD), an index of perceived risk of predation at an artificial food patch, and the second was the 'spool-and-line' approach, whereby unravelling spools attached to rodent bodies are used to trace their tracks. For our GUD experiment, we chose four major sites in the forest; two representative of core habitat and two at the forest edge. Additionally, three characteristic microsites were used in the GUD experiment dense understory, open understory and near-burrows. We hypothesised that GUDs would be lower on every succeeding observation day as rats learn to use the food patches, higher GUDs would be observed in the forest edges and open microsites, and rats would show preference for the microhabitats with least exposure to potential predators. In support of our first hypothesis, we found that GUDs were highest on the first experimental nights of every session. We also found that GUDs in the forest edges were higher than GUDs in the forest core. Lower GUDs were observed close to the rat burrows and in dense understory microsites, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Tracking of rat movements using the spool-and-line method overall revealed an even use across microhabitats, with a weak preference for those with logs, dense understory or exposed ground.

The relative influences of food resources, security from predation and shelter from thermal extremes on space occupation are likely to vary with time of day and changing conditions over the seasonal cycle. We used hourly movement rates obtained from GPS telemetry to infer the predominant activity states of blue wildebeest in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, at different times of day. Food procurement was assumed to be the primary consideration during the morning and late afternoon, shade seeking to become important over midday, and security from predation to be the overriding factor at night when stalking predators are most active. Travelling excursions were expected to occur mostly during daylight when lurking predators are most readily detected. Movements beyond the preferred range should occur more frequently in the late dry season when food has been depleted and surface water sources become restricted. As anticipated, we observed shifts in space occupation by the collared wildebeest herds with time of day and activity state. During the night, wildebeest herds remained within the ranges they occupied during prime foraging times in the early morning and late afternoon. However, they contracted their space occupation away from habitat edges where concealment for stalking lions increased, both while resting and while foraging. Herds inconsistently expanded their space use into surrounding areas with more shade but taller grass over midday. Risky excursions beyond the prime foraging ranges became more frequent late in the dry season. Security from predation seemed to be the overriding influence and restricted access to food resources.

The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology. Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data. Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates. Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape. Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species. Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation.

Lions' ability to adjust their behaviour to reduce direct contact with humans may affect their survival. We used fine-scale GPS data to measure lions' response to humans at two scales: between land use types (commercial ranches versus pastoral lands) and with proximity to human-occupied locations (i.e. livestock enclosures: 'bomas') within commercial ranch land. Study lions on commercial ranches reacted to the location and activity levels of humans on the local scale, showing no overall spatial avoidance but fine-scale temporal partitioning in their use of areas in close proximity to bomas, being closest at times when human activity was lowest (i.e. between 2300 and 0500 hours). At the land use scale, however, lions showed significant (but not total) spatial avoidance of pastoral land, despite similar prey densities and habitat structure on both land use types, indicating that lions' ability to utilize pastoral land was limited by pastoral people. When lions did utilize pastoral land, they were more likely to do so during the dark hours, when people were confined to bomas, than during the daylight hours. Lions moved faster and straighter in pastoral lands and when close to bomas, indicating that they adjust 'how' they move in response to humans. They were found closer to bomas with increasing rainfall and decreasing moonlight. Overall, lion movements suggested an ability to partition their activities spatiotemporally with those of humans such that risk of human-caused mortality was minimized while use of a human-dominated landscape was maximized.

We used radiotelemetry to examine the relationship between body size and site fidelity, movements, and home range in 2 subspecies of Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis) wintering in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, USA. Both subspecies showed high interannual return rates to the Delta study area, but Greater Sandhill Cranes (G. c. tabida) showed stronger within-winter fidelity to landscapes in our study region and to roost complexes within landscapes than did Lesser Sandhill Cranes (G. c. canadensis). Foraging flights from roost sites were shorter for G. c. tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 +/- 0.01 km vs. 4.5 +/- 0.01 km, respectively) and, consequently, the mean size of 95% fixed-kernel winter home ranges was an order of magnitude smaller for G. c. tabida than for G. c. canadensis (1.9 +/- 0.4 km(2) vs. 21.9 +/- 1.9 km(2), respectively). Strong site fidelity indicates that conservation planning to manage for adequate food resources around traditional roost sites can be effective for meeting the habitat needs of these cranes, but the scale of conservation efforts should differ by subspecies. Analysis of movement patterns suggests that conservation planners and managers should consider all habitats within 5 km of a known G. c. tabida roost and within 10 km of a G. c. canadensis roost when planning for habitat management, mitigation, acquisition, and easements.",2015,10.1650/CONDOR-14-159.1,yes,telem,obs,Grus_canadensis,heron,bird,radio_triang,44,137,,144.2857143,303,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, movement, inferred_foraging, overwinter","some radio locs nivolved visual contact, where foraging was observed on some habitats... but that's it",

Newell; Cooper, Robert J.; Schweitzer, Sara H.; Greenberg, Russell S.",Rusty Blackbird Patch Use During Winter in Suburban Landscapes,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,"The rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a species of conservation concern throughout its range because of rapid population decline. During winter, relatively large flocks are in suburban landscapes within the Georgia and South Carolina Piedmont Plateau of the southeastern United States. We studied radio-tagged blackbirds within flocks that moved daily among 3 distinct patch types: pecan (Carya illinoinensis) and small-seeded oak (Quercus spp.) groves, shallowly flooded forested wetlands, and residential areas landscaped with turf grass. The patch types used for foraging have varying availability of invertebrate and mast food. We investigated the relationship between daily observations of blackbird flocks and previous, current, and oncoming short-term weather. Suburban landscapes with the appropriate configuration of shallow wetland, residential lawns, and mast grove patches within a 153-415-ha area, the size of patch aggregations in this study, likely constitute high quality wintering areas for this species. Blackbird flocks were 1.6-1.8 times more likely to be observed foraging in wetlands with each 10 degrees C increase in current temperature, 1.5 times more likely in wetlands for every 5 days with no previous precipitation, and 3.2 times more likely in wetlands with every 10 extra hours of oncoming cold weather. Blackbirds were 4.1-4.5 times less likely to be observed foraging in forested wetlands with every 5-mm increase in current precipitation. Blackbirds were 2.2 times more likely to be observed in mast groves with every 5-mm of oncoming precipitation. Radio-tagged blackbirds used pecan groves for foraging in 2011 but not 2012, which was an overall warmer winter. Pecan groves may be a sporadically used component of a combination of foraging patches that are rarely near flooded forested wetlands or residential areas. Our results can be used to identify and conserve patch components used by rusty blackbird flocks during winter in suburban nature parks and greenways.

However, gaps in knowledge about their human-related behaviour hamper effective management decisions. We studied non-breeding common ravens Corvus corax that aggregated and predated livestock in the surroundings of a landfill. Combining several approaches, we first assessed the effectiveness of relocations at distances ranging from 20 to 240km, and of one-time disturbance consisting in non-lethal shots performed at night roosts and at surrounding foraging areas during two consecutive evenings, in reducing ravens' presence at the landfill. Then, we documented the spatial ecology of both relocated ravens and control ones (i.e. released in situ). Although the return probability widely varied with relocation distance and time after release, homing behaviour (87/102 relocated ravens marked with wing tags [85.3%] returned to the landfill in 3years) prevented relocations from sustainably reducing the presence of ravens. Likewise, one-time disturbance only decreased ravens' abundance during a few hours. These results could be related to the extensive movements of ravens equipped with GPS trackers. The total area occupied by control ravens reached 40,492km(2), i.e. 7.4% of the area of France and 21.7% of the French species distribution range. Individuals used smaller home ranges (min=84; max=1814km(2)), consisting in a network of foraging areas and roosts that they visited. The daily and weekly turnover rates in the observed area of the landfill were high (on average 0.68 +/- 0.2 and 0.36 +/- 0.17, respectively) and the actual presence of ravens displayed strong seasonal variation. Hence, one-time/local management actions affected only a limited proportion of the population, partly explaining their small impact.

To maximize fitness, animals with offspring show the most pronounced alteration in behavior because mothers experience increased nutritional requirements and increased vulnerability to predation. Therefore, the tolerance of risk is shaped, in part, by reproductive state. Like prey species, mesopredators balance a trade-off between food and predation to maximize fitness. However, few studies have acknowledged its importance. We investigated how mesopredators may alter their space use between periods when young are and are not vulnerable. Investigating the fine-scale space use of 19 packs of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus in the Kruger National Park, we found lower risk tolerance of denning packs; they re-visited area less frequently as lion and impala density increased and thus reduced the likelihood of risky encounters by avoiding areas where both risk and reward were high. By contrast, non-denning packs re-visited area less frequently as lion density increased and impala density decreased and thus avoided areas where reward was low, especially if risk was high. These results suggest that wild dogs shift their patterns of space use when the pack is most vulnerable. Ultimately, we found evidence of decreased risk tolerance by denning packs, likely because of increased vulnerability of lactating mothers and immobile pups. More broadly, our findings suggest that risk tolerance is dependent on reproductive state for mesopredators and should be considered as a possible mechanism for other mesopredators as well.",2021,10.1093/beheco/arab018,yes,remote,obs,Lycaon_pictus,carnivore,mammal,GPS,19,19142,,1069.631579,178.2719298,C,yes,resting,"habitat_selection, movement, resource_availability","not really about foraging, but movement/searching/hunting is close",

This is especially useful for species occupying remote landscapes where direct behavioural observations are limited. In this study, we fit a mechanistic model of animal cognition and movement to GPS positional data of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; Gmelin 1788) collected over a wide range of ecological conditions. 2. The model explicitly tracks individual animal informational state over space and time, with resulting parameter estimates that have direct cognitive and ecological meaning. Three biotic landscape attributes were hypothesized to motivate caribou movement: forage abundance (dietary digestible biomass), wolf (Canis lupus; Linnaeus, 1758) density and moose (Alces alces; Linnaeus, 1758) habitat. Wolves are the main predator of caribou in this system and moose are their primary prey. 3. Resulting parameter estimates clearly indicated that forage abundance is an important driver of caribou movement patterns, with predator and moose avoidance often having a strong effect, but not for all individuals. From the cognitive perspective, our results support the notion that caribou rely on limited sensory inputs from their surroundings, as well as on long-term spatial memory, to make informed movement decisions.

The bats roost in a huge maternal colony that is far from the foraging grounds but allows their pups to thermoregulate [3] while the mothers are foraging. Thus, the mothers have to fly tens of kilometers to the foraging sites-fields with thousands of Saguaro cacti [4, 5]. Once at the field, they must compete with many other bats over the same flowering cacti. Several solutions have been suggested for this classical foraging task of exploiting a resource composed of many renewable food sources whose locations are fixed. Some animals randomly visit the food sources [6], and some actively defend a restricted foraging territory [7-11] or use simple forms of learning, such as win-stay lose-switch'' strategy [12]. Many species have been suggested to follow a trapline, that is, to revisit the food sources in a repeating ordered manner [13-22]. We thus hypothesized that lesser long-nosed bats would visit cacti in a sequenced manner. Using miniature GPS devices, aerial imaging, and video recordings, we tracked the full movement of the bats and all of their visits to their natural food sources.

This information can reduce uncertainty about nest locations, mates or food sources. However, there is little empirical evidence that colonies can actually serve as an information exchange point. We asked whether a large nesting colony of ring-billed gulls, Larus delawarensis, could provide its members with social information about the quality and location of food resources during the chick-rearing period. We first determined whether social information was available in the colony, then whether it was signalled by some reliable cue, and finally, whether the birds used it by following knowledgeable individuals. We combined observations of flight departure bearings at the colony with flight tracks obtained from birds fitted with global positioning system (GPS) data loggers. We found that reliable information about feeding site locations could be obtained by observing the vanishing bearings of gulls leaving their nest. Birds nesting in different parts of the colony flew in different directions to reach their feeding grounds, but this did not influence the type of food brought to the chicks. To test whether gulls actually followed departing individuals, we searched for temporal clumping of departures and bearings for different time intervals during a day. We found that departures of gulls nesting in the same neighbourhood were not temporally clustered, nor did the gulls tend to leave in the same direction as their previously departing neighbours. We conclude that ring-billed gulls do not appear to use social information at the nest site to locate foraging opportunities. However, stopovers on nearby water or along the colony edge after a short flight from the nest could allow exchange of information that we could not document.

However, to date, studies have not fully elucidated how fine- and broad-scale habitat decisions by individual prey can help balance food versus risk. We studied broad-scale habitat selection by Newfoundland caribou Rangifer tarandus, focusing on trade-offs between predation risk versus access to forage during the calving and post-calving period. We improved traditional measures of habitat availability by incorporating fine-scale movement patterns of caribou into the availability kernel, thus enabling separation of broad and fine scales of selection. Remote sensing and field surveys served to create a spatio-temporal model of forage availability, whereas GPS telemetry locations from 66 black bears Ursus americanus and 59 coyotes Canis latrans provided models of predation risk. We then used GPS telemetry locations from 114 female caribou to assess food-predation trade-offs through the prism of our refined model of caribou habitat availability. We noted that migratory movements of caribou were oriented mainly towards habitats with abundant forage and lower risk of bear and (to a lesser extent) coyote encounter. These findings were generally consistent across caribou herds and would not have been evident had we used traditional methods instead of our refined model when estimating habitat availability. We interpret these findings in the context of stereotypical migratory behaviour observed in Newfoundland caribou, which occurs despite the extirpation of wolves Canis lupus nearly a century ago. We submit that caribou are able to balance food acquisition against predation risk using a complex set of factors involving both finer and broader scale selection. Accordingly, our study provides a strong argument for using refined habitat availability estimates when assessing food-predation trade-offs.",2015,10.1111/ecog.01305,yes,remote,obs,Rangifer_tarandus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, RSF",114,70000,,3375.122807,360,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, parental_care, inferred_foraging",area estimated from proportion of NL covered by study area,

Using telemetry data, we investigated nonruminant zebra (Equus burchelli) and ruminant red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus subspecies camaa), use of burnt patches in a landscape mosaic of nutrient-poor, old grassland interspersed with young, recently burnt, nutrient-rich grass patches. The Mkambati Nature Reserve landscape on the east coast of South Africa provided large grazers with a challenge in finding and using appropriate patches in which to forage to meet their nutritional requirements. In Mkambati, grassland fires, mostly ignited by poachers, induce regrowth of young nutrient-rich grass, which subsequently attract grazers. We tested if the study animals foraged more in burnt patches than in the unburned grassland and whether burnt patch use was related to the distance to the previously visited burnt patch, burnt patch size, burnt patch age, and distance to areas with high poaching risk using MANOVA. In general, zebra moved faster than red hartebeest, and both species moved faster in unburnt grassland than in burnt patches. Red hartebeest and zebra patch selection were influenced by interpatch distance, patch age, patch size, and poaching risk. A limited set of intrinsic traits, i.e., body mass, digestion strategy, and muzzle width, yielded different patch use rules for the two species.

I used a one-predator-one-prey system, puma (Puma concolor)-mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to test the following predictions regarding predator-prey distribution and patch use by the predator. (1) Pumas will spend more time in high prey risk/low prey use habitat types, while deer will spend their time in low-risk habitats. Pumas should (2) select large forage patches more often, (3) remain in large patches longer, and (4) revisit individual large patches more often than individual smaller ones. I tested these predictions with an extensive telemetry data set collected over 16 years in a study area of patchy forested habitat. When active, pumas spent significantly less time in open areas of low intrinsic predation risk than did deer. Pumas used large patches more than expected, revisited individual large patches significantly more often than smaller ones, and stayed significantly longer in larger patches than in smaller ones. The results supported the prediction of a negative relationship in the spatial distribution of a predator and its prey and indicated that the predator is incorporating the prey's imperfect information about its presence.

In species with a central resting or breeding place, there can be conflict between the environmental requirements of the 'central place' and foraging habitat. We apply a multi-scale SDM to examine habitat trade-offs between the central place, roost sites, and foraging habitat in Myotis nattereri. We validate these derived associations using habitat selection from behavioural observations of radio-tracked bats. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) of roost occurrence using land cover variables with mixed spatial scales indicated roost occurrence was positively associated with woodland on a fine scale and pasture on a broad scale. Habitat selection of radio-tracked bats mirrored the SDM with bats selecting for woodland in the immediate vicinity of individual roosts but avoiding this habitat in foraging areas, whilst pasture was significantly positively selected for in foraging areas. Using habitat selection derived from radio-tracking enables a multi-scale SDM to be interpreted in a behavioural context. We suggest that the multi-scale SDM of M. nattereri describes a trade-off between the central place and foraging habitat. Multi-scale methods provide a greater understanding of the ecological processes which determine where species occur and allow integration of behavioural processes into SDMs. The findings have implications when assessing the resource use of a species at a single point in time.

Large mammals presumably perceive their surroundings at broad spatial scales, but the importance of landscape-level food resource properties for habitat use is generally less understood. We evaluated the role of heterogeneity of Canada buffaloberry Shepherdia canadensis, defined by fruit distribution and variability in patch quality (fruit density), in grizzly bear Ursus arctos habitat selection by comparing patch- and landscape-level foraging strategies (resource use). Our objectives were to: 1) identify the spatial scale at which grizzly bears select buffaloberry fruit resources; 2) determine whether patch- or landscape-level foraging strategies explain resource use; and 3) assess the importance of resource heterogeneity in structuring habitat selection. Buffaloberry patch and landscape variables were combined with GPS radio-telemetry data from eight collared grizzly bears in west-central Alberta, Canada, to fit resource selection functions (RSFs). We found that a spatial scale of 1887 m, corresponding to an average travel distance for bears over 5.5 h, was the most supported scale for buffaloberry use. Landscape-level foraging strategies generally had more support than those of the patch-level, with spatial heterogeneity of buffaloberry patches best explaining grizzly bear selection for fruit resources. Bears selected for areas with a wider distribution of buffaloberry fruit and greater variability in patch quality, thus providing both a higher probability of shrub encounter and greater contrast between resource patches. A negative interaction between distribution and variability, however, indicated a tradeoff where use of areas with a more widespread fruit distribution decreased when variability in resource quality was high.

We tested the hypothesis that roadways would affect moose habitat selection and that moose behaviour would vary with time, proximity to roads, type of roadway, and environmental characteristics (i.e., habitat and topography). We equipped 47 moose with GPS telemetry collars and assessed habitat selection using resource selection functions. Moose searched primarily for areas with high forage availability, but they also avoided highways and forest roads, although avoidance usually disappeared beyond 100-250 m. Avoidance was not directly proportional to noise disturbance; moose systematically avoided the first 100 m adjacent to forest roads, while habitats adjacent to highway sides were sometimes used in proportion to their availability. The benefits of using habitats adjacent to highways may be greater than the costs to moose, which was not always the case for forest roads. The road-avoidance zone varied seasonally but was generally wider for males than females, suggesting that males were more sensitive to road disturbance. We believe that moose frequent highways and associated roadsides to find food and mineral salts, and possibly to reduce predation risk for females. Topography was also an important correlate of habitat selection by moose, especially for females, which had significant selection coefficients for altitude and slope in almost every season. Proper assessment of human impacts on ungulates in natural environments requires consideration of unpaved forest roads. In a study area with a small human footprint and low road density (0.16 km.km(-2)), moose selection patterns suggested they minimized potential risks associated with highways at the coarse scale while seeking short-term benefits of highway roadsides, i.e., sodium in vegetation and pools, at the finer spatial scale.",2012,10.2980/19-1-3461,yes,remote,obs,Alces_alces,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, RSF",47,1800,,4227.170213,1095,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, road_avoidance","habitat types were sorted into ""food"", ""food + shelter"", ""shelter"", etc. based on previous reports",

This became manifest in Europe in the past decade in light of the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). However, the obvious effects of policy decisions on foraging behavior are lacking. Here, we use data from a long-term study (1992-2015) of the ecology of the bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus in the Pyrenees to assess whether or not the implementation of health policies in the period 2006-2011 really did affect this vultures foraging behavior and breeding success. To test this, we used the frequency of nest changeovers (between 1992 and 2015) as a surrogate for the time invested in searching for and obtaining food. Additionally, between 2006 and 2015 we monitored the movements of 20 bearded vultures with GPS satellite transmitters. Our findings show no differences between annual home range sizes and/or the time used to search for food either before, during or after the imposition of health regulations. No differences between periods (during or after health regulations) were found in the use of supplementary feeding sites (SFS).

During winter, large herbivores living under low predation pressure mainly trade-off benefits of forage acquisition with the costs of exposure to harsh weather conditions. We assessed the changes in this trade-off for white-tailed deer adult females on Anticosti Island (Canada) at different scales during 2 contrasted winters (i.e., a harsher and a milder winter). We hypothesized that deer should adjust their foraging decisions to avoid cold wind-chill temperatures and high locomotion costs in deep snow as winter severity increased. We compared habitat selection at the home-range scale, habitat selection relative to thermal conditions within the home range, and selection for foraging sites relative to snow conditions along the foraging tracks between winters. Home-range selection of deer was similar between winters. Deer adjusted their within-home-range selection relative to thermal conditions: they selected thermal cover during cold-stress periods while their selection for open areas increased during the warmer periods. Deer showed high behavioral plasticity along their foraging tracks: they selected tracks with different forage resources between winters and traded-off the locomotion costs in deep snow cover with the benefits of forage availability as winter severity increased. We discuss how behavioral plasticity of deer in their thermoregulatory behavior and foraging site selection allows them to cope with varying winter conditions, in a system where their short-term behavioral adaptations were already strongly constrained by intraspecific competition.",2017,10.1093/beheco/arx062,yes,ethology,obs,Odocoileus_virginianus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, RSF, tracking",27,271,,15008,134,BC,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, snow_tracking, forage_availability","used GPS to get habitat use, but also followed tracks in winter to get finescale (numbers here are for GPS, tracking not reported well)",
Mitchell_2015,"Mitchell, Numi; Strohbach, Michael W.; Pratt, Ralph; Finn, Wendy C.; Strauss, Eric G.",Space use by resident and transient coyotes in an urban-rural landscape mosaic,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Context. Coyotes (Canis latrans) have adapted successfully to human landscape alteration in the past 150 years and in recent decades have successfully moved into urban areas. While this causes concern about human-wildlife conflicts, research also suggests that coyotes tend to avoid humans and human activity in urban areas. For improving management, a better understanding of space use by coyotes is needed. Aims. To study how coyote social behaviour influences fine-scale space use in urban areas we present results from an extensive, multi-year GPS telemetry study (2005-13). The study area in coastal Rhode Island is a mosaic of rural, suburban and urban land use and coyotes have only recently arrived. Methods. We differentiated between two social classes: residents (individuals that have established a territory; n = 24) and transients (individuals that have no territory; n = 7). Space use was analysed using mixed effect models and detailed land-cover data. Key results. Coyotes tended to select for agricultural and densely vegetated land cover and against land used for housing and commerce. Pasture and cropland were preferred by residents and avoided by transients, especially at night, indicating the role of agricultural land as prime foraging habitat. Both groups selected densely vegetated land cover for daytime shelter sites. Transients selected for densely vegetated land cover both day and night, indicating use for both shelter and foraging. Resident coyotes avoided high-and medium-density housing more than transients. Conclusions. We interpret land-cover selection by resident coyotes as indicative of coyote habitat preference, while transients more often occupied marginal habitats that probably do not reflect their preferences. Differences in land cover selection between residents and transients suggest that transients have a corollary strategy to avoid residents. Implications. With cover and food appearing to be important drivers of space use, coexistence strategies can build on controlling food resources as well as on the tendency of coyotes to avoid humans. Nevertheless, transients, having the need to avoid territorial resident coyotes as well, show a reduced aversion to land cover with high human activity, creating a higher potential for human-wildlife conflicts.",2015,10.1071/WR15020,yes,remote,obs,Canis_latrans,carnivore,mammal,GPS,31,125,,1036.16129,2920,C,yes,habitat_selection,"habitat_selection, urban, long_term, inferred_foraging",,

The profitability of food resources can vary spatially, depending on occurrence, quality, and local abundance. Here, we used the brown bear (Ursus arctos) as a model species to quantify selective foraging on berries in different habitats during hyperphagia in autumn prior to hibernation. During the peak berry season in August and September, we sampled berry occurrence, abundance, and sugar content, a proxy for quality, at locations selected by bears for foraging and at random locations in the landscape. The factors determining selection of berries were species specific across the different habitats. Compared to random locations, bears selected locations with a higher probability of occurrence and higher abundance of bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) and a higher probability of occurrence, but not abundance, of lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Crowberries (Empetrum hermaphroditum) were least available and least used. Sugar content affected the selection of lingonberries, but not of bilberries. Abundance of bilberries at random locations decreased and abundance of lingonberries increased during fall, but bears did not adjust their foraging strategy by increasing selection for lingonberries. Forestry practices had a large effect on berry occurrence and abundance, and brown bears responded by foraging most selectively in mature forests and on clearcuts. This study shows that bears are successful in navigating human-shaped forest landscapes by using areas of higher than average berry abundance in a period when abundant food intake is particularly important to increase body mass prior to hibernation. Food resources heterogeneity, caused by spatial and temporal variation of specific foods, poses a challenge to foragers, particularly when faced with extraordinary energy-demanding events, like hibernation. Brown bears in Sweden inhabit a landscape shaped by forestry practices. Bilberries and lingonberries, the bears' main food resources in autumn prior to hibernation, show different temporal and habitat-specific ripening patterns. We quantified the bears' selective foraging on these berry species on clearcuts, bogs, young, and mature forests compared to random locations. Despite a temporal decline of ripe bilberries, bears used locations with a greater occurrence and abundance of bilberries, but not lingonberries. We conclude that bears successfully navigated in this heavily human-shaped landscape by selectively foraging in high-return habitats for bilberries, but did not compensate for the decline in bilberries by eating more lingonberries.",2016,10.1007/s00265-016-2106-2,yes,remote_tracking,obs,Ursus_arctos,carnivore,mammal,GPS,7,2100,,1236.48,28,C,yes,movement,"habitat_selection, veg_surveys","used step length to estimate foraging vs. resting vs. travelling, in relation to berry patches. no mention of area, but other paper from same system said 2100",

In this study, we explored whether moonlight affected hunting behaviour and success in a largely wooded environment. Measures of short-term lion movements (distance moved, displacement and path tortuosity) derived from GPS telemetry data were used as indicators of movement behaviour. Field observations of belly distension were used to assess recent food intake. Lions had greater belly distension (indicating feeding success) on dark nights.

Lone_2015,"Lone, Karen; Loe, Leif Egil; Meisingset, Erling L.; Stamnes, Inga; Mysterud, Atle",An adaptive behavioural response to hunting: surviving male red deer shift habitat at the onset of the hunting season,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Hunting by humans can be a potent driver of selection for morphological and life history traits in wildlife populations across continents and taxa. Few studies, however, have documented selection on behavioural responses that increase individual survival under human hunting pressure. Using habitat with dense concealing cover is a common strategy for risk avoidance, with a higher chance of survival being the payoff. At the same time, risk avoidance can be costly in terms of missed foraging opportunities. We investigated individual fine-scale use of habitat by 40 GPS-marked European red deer, Cervus elaphus, and linked this to their survival through the hunting season. Whereas all males used similar habitat in the days before the hunting season, the onset of hunting induced an immediate switch to habitat with more concealing cover in surviving males, but not in males that were later shot. This habitat switch also involved a trade-off with foraging opportunities on bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, a key forage plant in autumn. Moreover, deer that use safer forest habitat might survive better because they make safer choices in general. The lack of a corresponding pattern in females might be because females were already largely using cover when hunting started, as predicted by sexual segregation theory and the risk of losing offspring. The behavioural response of males to the onset of hunting appears to be adaptive, given that it is linked to increased survival, an important fitness component. We suggest that predictable harvesting regimes with high harvest rates could create a strong selective pressure for deer to respond dynamically to the temporal change in hunting risk. Management should consider the potential for both ecological and evolutionary consequences of harvesting regimes on behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Analyses of behavioural organization are increasingly used for this purpose, to identify animals in pathological or otherwise challenged states. Here, we investigated the possible impact of gastrointestinal helminth infection on the behaviour of wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, by applying fractal analysis to their feeding patterns. We predicted that higher intensity of strongylid infection should be associated with altered organizational complexity in temporal sequences of behaviour. We observed 15 habituated male chimpanzees in Kalinzu Reserve Forest, Uganda, and collected behavioural time series via focal animal sampling. We quantified the number of strongylid eggs per gram of faecal sediment using a modified simple sedimentation method to estimate the intensity of infection with strongylid nematodes. We used detrended fluctuation analysis ( DFA) to explore long-range dependence in binary sequences of feeding behaviour as an index of organizational complexity along a stochastic-deterministic gradient. We then built several generalized linear mixed models to examine the relationship between behavioural organization and strongylid infection. Our results indicate that chimpanzee feeding sequences are long-range dependent and antipersistent, i.e. short bouts tended to be followed by long bouts and vice versa. Furthermore, the complexity of chimpanzee feeding sequences and the intensity of infection with strongylid nematodes were positively related: individuals with more intense infections exhibited more stochastic feeding sequences. In contrast, more conventional analyses did not reveal any relationship between parasitism and chimpanzee behaviour, nor did a survival analysis find variation in the probability of switching between behaviour states across chimpanzees with varying infection phenotypes. This work suggests that strongylid nematodes do pose a challenge for wild chimpanzees, manifest as altered organizational complexity in behaviour sequences, and provides further evidence that fractal analyses can have a valuable role in animal health monitoring.

Sex, social tactic, season and food availability are important factors influencing activity budgets. However, few field studies have tested their influences. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) lives in highly seasonal habitats in southern Africa, and individuals can adopt different social tactics. We investigated seasonal changes in activity budgets of different tactics and predicted that individuals will reduce their activity in the non-breeding season to save energy when food availability is low and that young non-breeding adults ('philopatrics') invest mainly in activities related to gaining body mass to increase survival probability. We predicted old adults ('breeders'), which bred during the previous breeding season, to invest mainly in maintenance of their social status. We conducted 90 focal observations during the non-breeding season and 73 during the breeding season. Activity budgets of striped mice were season and tactic specific, with philopatrics, but not breeders, reducing activity when food availability was low, possibly to decrease energy expenditure. Philopatrics of both sexes foraged and basked more in the breeding season than during the non-breeding season. Male philopatrics gained body mass and female philopatrics maintained their body mass in both seasons. Sex-specific differences occurred during the breeding season, when female breeders foraged more than male breeders, while male breeders chased other individuals more than female breeders.

Peter",Working the crowd: sociable vervets benefit by reducing exposure to risk,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Reduction of predation risk represents the most likely explanation for the evolution of group-living among the anthropoid primates. Obligate sociality leads to increased competition for resources, meaning that animals may face a trade-off between safe positions within the troop and increased foraging efficiency. Dominance has been proposed to be a major factor influencing spatial position within primate troops, but it is also possible that animals can improve their spatial position using social strategies, such as grooming. In many species, dominance rank and social preference (as expressed through grooming) are confounded. In our study population of vervet monkeys, however, dominance does not underpin social preference, enabling us to test whether 1) more sociable vervets experience reduced exposure to predation risk, as indexed by vigilance, and 2) that dominant animals accepted increased risk in order to forage at the front of the troop. We collected spatially explicit data on the individual locations of members of 2 troops at predetermined times over a 4-month period. We constructed bounded Voronoi tessellations for each temporal snapshot, with the area of each animal's tile identifying its domain of danger. We also collected data on time spent vigilant and foraging, dominance rank, and grooming behavior. We found no effect of dominance, but animals with larger grooming networks were less exposed to predation risk, from which they benefitted through both reduced vigilance and increased foraging time.

If fruiting plants could affect their dispersal vector, the plants also affect their seed dispersal distance and eventually their plant population biology. From 2007 to 2011, we measured seed transport by georeference daily bonobo group movements via GPS. Seed dispersal distance was estimated with mechanistic model, using 1200 georeferenced dispersal events and the average seed transit time through bonobo (24.00 h). We compared dissemination for eight plant species that deal with this trade-off: attracting dispersers by means of fruit quality/quantity versus retaining them in the patch because of the same quality/quantity value that attracted them. Because fruit traits of these eight species were different, we expected a difference in seed dispersal distance. Surprisingly, seed dispersal distances induced by bonobos were not affected by fruit traits. Although fruit nutrient contents, abundance and average patch feeding duration differed between plant species, patch feeding time was not related to subsequent dispersal distances. The apes' dispersal distance survey gave an average dispersal distance estimated of 1332 +/- 24 m from the parent plant (97.9% > 100 m).

M.; Castellanos, F.; Ramos-Fernandez, G.",Uncovering the decision rules behind collective foraging in spider monkeys,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Unlike animals living in cohesive groups, those in groups with high fission-fusion dynamics can separate temporarily from other group members. While mechanisms underlying collective decisions are not well understood, it is possible that these separations occur by a divergence of interests between individuals. We evaluated the collective foraging decisions made by a group of Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi, in a tropical forest in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We assessed whether each individual's centrality in the social network, years living in the group, age, sex and social relationships affected the collective decisions. We examined two collective dynamics: foraging movements and arrivals to novel food patches, and in the latter, identified knowledgeable and naive individuals. In both dynamics, spider monkeys exhibited partially shared leadership influenced by individual attributes, particularly the centrality in the social network, age and time in the group. These attributes have been associated with ecological knowledge. In arrivals to novel food patches, individuals most likely to have information about food resources (i.e. central individuals and males) had a greater likelihood to be followed, suggesting an influence of social information on the tendency to follow others. Also, we show evidence that social information could accelerate the arrival of naive individuals to these patches. Collective foraging dynamics in our study group seem to arise from local rules that each individual follows when foraging: when a naive individual needs social information to forage, it will follow the individual that is more likely to have this information, i.e. a central individual or a male; otherwise, when it is not possible or necessary to use social information, naive individuals will follow a partner with which they have a strong social relationship. Thus, the interaction between local decision rules and the structure of the social network could drive collective coordination in fission-fusion dynamics.

We analyzed feeding and resting observations separately while distinguishing between routine and induced scans in four groups of wild ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) experiencing scramble competition for food and infanticide risk. We used linear mixed-effect models to test the effect of group size, age-sex class, number of neighbors, number of adult male neighbors, and height in the canopy on scanning rates (vigilance) with and without evident conspecific threat. Food type was also examined in the feeding models. Perceived predation risk affected vigilance more than scramble competition for food and infanticide risk. Routine and induced vigilance were greatest at lower canopy heights during feeding and resting and increased when individuals had fewer neighbors while resting. A group size effect was found on induced vigilance while resting, but scanning increased with group size, which probably indicates visual monitoring of conspecifics. Scanning rates decreased while feeding on foods that required extensive manipulation. This supports the idea that vigilance is relatively cost free for upright feeders when eating food that requires little manipulation, a common feature of folivore diets.

As such, ecological and physiological factors contribute to stimuli influencing navigation, extent of movement, and therefore habitat use. Our study focused on the intensity of activity (from acceleration data) and extent of movement (from GPS and thread trailing data) of Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) in a fragmented landscape near their northern population limit. First, we quantified the thermal performance curve of box turtles using activity as a measure of performance. Second, we investigated ecological factors that could influence activity and movement and characterized the movement as extensive (exploration) and intensive (foraging). Results: In contrast to previous lab work investigating effects of temperature on activity, we found no relationship between box turtle activity and temperature in the field. Furthermore, box turtle activity was consistent over a wide range of temperatures. Cluster analysis categorized movement recorded with GPS more as intensive than as extensive, while thread trailing had more movement categorized as extensive than intensive. Box turtle activity was higher during the morning hours and began to decrease as the day progressed. Based on the microclimate conditions tested, we found that box turtle movement was influenced by precipitation and time of day, and activity was most influenced by absolute humidity, ambient temperature, cloud cover, and time of day. Conclusions: Our model ectotherm in this study, the Eastern box turtle, had activity patterns characteristic of a thermal generalist. Sampling resolution altered the characterization of movement as intensive or extensive movement, possibly altering interpretation. More information on the resolution needed to definitively identify foraging and exploratory behavior in turtles is needed.

Since capuchin monkeys are small-sized extractive foragers that cannot perform forceful precision grips, we expected that: (a) they would use other body parts together with their hands, (b) older (and larger) capuchins would be more efficient than younger (and smaller) ones, and (c) capuchins would invest greater effort/time to exploit USOs than other foods. Materials and MethodsWe recorded 178 episodes of USO processing performed by 20 individuals. The behavior was videotaped and scored frame-by-frame. ResultsWe identified six sequential stages of processing: Excavation, extraction, soil removal, transport, peeling, and fragmenting the inner tissues. Capuchins made frequent use of forceful hand postures and manipulation in which the hands were strongly supported by other body parts, principally the mouth. Older capuchins were more efficient than younger individuals in pulling the USOs out of the ground. Finally, exploiting USOs was time-consuming, lasting more than 4 min per item, on average. DiscussionDespite having smaller body-mass and greater manual constraints than catarrhine extractive foragers, capuchins, even smaller individuals, mastered USO processing thanks to their behavioral flexibility and persistence. Our findings reveal that precision grips are not essential for forceful actions during complex food processing and that, unlike catarrhines, capuchins, especially adults, rarely use thumb opposition during forceful grasping of food.

We combined remote biologger technology, capturing continuous heart rate values, with locational data from GPS collars to investigate the behavioral and physiological reactions of American black bears (Ursus americanus) to a landscape dominated by agriculture (52.5% areal cover). Our study occurred at the edge of the range of this species, with small, scattered patches of forest within a mosaic of crop fields and an extensive road network. However, only; similar to 2-4% of the area contained crops that bears consumed (corn, sunflowers, oats). We used GPS locations to identify the habitat that bears occupied, and to estimate their rates of travel. Heart rates increased with movement rates, rising by over 30% from resting rate to their fastest travel speeds. We used a modeling approach to distinguish among factors that influenced heart rates independent of movement rates. Bears commonly crossed agricultural areas that provided no food or cover and their heart rates, elevated beyond what was expected from their movement rate, were indicative of a stress response. However, when bears entered agricultural areas composed of edible crops, many individuals showed reduced movement and slower heart rates, suggesting that bears foraging there felt at ease or crops allow bears to more easily forage due to their dense spatial arrangements. Unexpectedly, female bears elicited lower heart rates and lower levels of activity in the most fragmented patches of natural habitat, possibly a sign of human-avoidance behavior or a reaction related to crossing roads.

Here, we describe heterospecific groups composed of splendid and variegated fairy-wrens (Malurus splendens and M. lamberti) and provide the first experimental evidence that recognition of heterospecific group members occurs across species. In these species, family groups live on overlapping territories and co-defend shared territories against both heterospecific and conspecific intruders. Individuals on shared territories were frequently observed traveling and foraging together. Socially dominant males of both species responded more aggressively to songs of neighboring and foreign heterospecific fairy-wrens than they did to those of their co-resident hetero-specifics. Although splendid fairy-wrens did not change their behavior when associating with heterospecifics, variegated fairy-wrens spent more time foraging, were less vigilant, had greater first-nest fledging success, and fewer extra-group young.

On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used a combination of acoustic playback experiments, remote camera monitoring, and GPS tracking to quantify the frequency of such interactions, determine who initiates and maintains spatial associations, and test whether terrestrial animals adopt a strategy of acoustic eavesdropping to locate fruit patches created by foraging primates. Indeed, 90% of fruits collected in fruit fall traps had tooth marks of arboreal frugivores, and terrestrial frugivores visited fruit trees sooner following visits by GPS-collared monkeys. While our play back experiments were insufficient to support the hypothesis that terrestrial frugivores use auditory cues to locate food dropped by arboreal primates, analyses of movement paths of capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus), spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), and coatis (Nasua narica) reveal that observed patterns of interspecific attraction are not merely a byproduct of mutual attraction to shared resources. Coatis were significantly more likely to initiate close encounters with arboreal primates than vice versa and maintained these associations by spending significantly longer periods at fruiting trees when collared primates were present. Our results demonstrate that terrestrial frugivores are attracted to arboreal primates, likely because they increase local resource availability.

Here, we report evidence of interspecific interactions between this species and some synanthropic co-occurring birds in three urban parks of Rome (central Italy). In both nesting and feeding sites, we recorded 158 interactions with seven syntopic species in eight colonial focal nests (0.74 events/hr). The number and frequency of interactions significantly differ among nests and species, the Italian Sparrow (Passer italiae) being the most interactive species. For this species, the frequency of interactions was normally distributed between different months with a peak in June. We also observed a case of nest cohabitation, as well as predatory attacks carried out by Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix). As far as foraging sites are concerned, 11 out of 74 clusters of parakeets (15%) hosted four bird species, mainly Starling, Sturnus vulgaris, but we did not observe any interactions. Although Monk Parakeet is a social bird generally tolerant towards other species near their nests and in foraging areas, we observed interspecific interactions in nesting sites as a response to competitive or predatory mechanisms. Italian Sparrows interact because they use parakeet nests as a secondary structure for nesting (cohabitation) and, probably, because of the wide availability of food resources (invertebrates) useful for juvenile recruitment. The interaction of parakeets with Hooded Crow is a response to predatory attacks on eggs or juveniles. However, interspecific interactions seem to be occasional events in nesting sites and are apparently absent in feeding sites, where competitive behaviour is probably reduced due to high availability of plant resources.

All three species used different foraging substrates and attack manoeuvres in different habitat types. The Green bra frequently used lower strata when foraging in forest patches as opposed to continuous forest, while the Pin-striped Tit-Babbler tended to forage in more dense vegetation in patches. Only Chestnut-winged Babbler displayed complete foraging plasticity across all study parameters. Different habitat features (e.g., edges, microclimates) between continuous forest and forest patches significantly influenced the foraging strategies of the study species.

In this study, conducted in a tropical evergreen forest in the Western Ghats of India, we used intra-flock association patterns to generate a community-wide assessment of flocking benefits for different species. We assumed that individuals needed to be physically proximate to particular heterospecific individuals within flocks to obtain any direct foraging benefit (flushed prey, kleptoparasitism, copying foraging locations). Alternatively, for anti-predation benefits, physical proximity to particular heterospecifics is not required, i.e. just being in the flock vicinity can suffice. Therefore, we used choice of locations within flocks to infer whether individual species are obtaining direct foraging or anti-predation benefits. A small subset of the bird community (5/29 species), composed of all members of the sallying guild, showed non-random physical proximity to heterospecifics within flocks. All preferred associates were from non-sallying guilds, suggesting that the sallying species were likely obtaining direct foraging benefits either in the form of flushed or kleptoparasitized prey. The majority of the species (24/29) chose locations randomly with respect to heterospecifics within flocks and, thus, were likely obtaining antipredation benefits. In summary, our study indicates that direct foraging benefits are important for only a small proportion of species in flocks and that predation is likely to be the main driver of flocking for most participants.

We compared the foraging behavior and microhabitat use of Wedge-billed Woodcreepers in and out of flocks at Tiputini Biodiversity Station, eastern Ecuador, during January-March, 2010-2012. We measured foraging height range, time spent per trunk, vertical movement rate, distance flown between trunks, extent of foliage cover around the focal bird, hitch rate, and peck rate. We tracked birds in 2012 using radiotelemetry to measure horizontal movement rates and to record the locations of flock-joining and -leaving. Wedge-billed Woodcreepers in flocks foraged in more exposed microhabitats, moved vertically at a faster rate despite a decrease in foraging height range, and exhibited greater hitch rates than individuals foraging alone. Peck rates, peck:hitch ratio, and distance flown between trunks did not differ between situations. Horizontal movement rate did not differ in and out of flocks, but the length of flock-following sessions was negatively correlated with movement rate above a threshold of 4 m min(-1).

Examining how performance (i.e., athletic ability) affects the outcomes of encounters between free-ranging predators and prey is essential for understanding the determinants of predation success rates and broad scale predator-prey dynamics, but quantifying these encounters in natural situations is logistically challenging. The goal of our study was to examine how various metrics of predator/prey performance determine predation success by studying natural predator-prey interactions in the field with minimal manipulation of the study subjects. We used high-speed video recordings of free-ranging sidewinder rattlesnakes (predator, Crotalus cerastes) and desert kangaroo rats (prey, Dipodomys deserti) to study how performance at various stages of their encounters alters the outcome of their interactions. We found that predation success depends on (a) whether the rattlesnake struck accurately, (b) if the rattlesnake strike was accurate, the reaction time and escape manoeuvres of the kangaroo rat, and (c) if the kangaroo rat was bitten, the ability of the kangaroo rat to use defensive manoeuvres to avoid subjugation by the snake.

A complete understanding of the functional significance of both predator attack behaviours and prey escape behaviours can only come from examining the interaction between both parties. For example, although the predatory strike of venomous snakes has been studied extensively in the laboratory, we have little understanding of the proximate factors influencing snake strike behaviour under natural conditions. Here, we report details of the analysis of predatory strikes of free-ranging rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) towards their natural prey. We found that over half of strike attempts were unsuccessful, and the most significant factor influencing strike success was the ability of prey animals to initiate a rapid evasive dodge manoeuvre in the fraction of a second after snakes initiated strikes, but before snake strikes contacted them. Snakes, in turn, initiated strikes most frequently towards the flank of laterally moving prey, which is probably an attempt to counter the ability of prey to dodge strikes.

We applied remote sensing techniques to extract environmental variables to use in state-space Hidden Markov Models and integrated Step Selection Function to analyse foraging strategies and land use selectivity, while using dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Minimum Convex Polygons to determine used and available habitat features within their home ranges. Our results show that Sumatran elephants in Aceh preferred areas with lower elevation (< 200 m) and slopes (0-10 degrees), with minimal terrain ruggedness, which also happen to be areas selected by humans.

However, we know little about how this behavior is affected by mast seeding.

Consistent with the food perishability hypothesis that squirrels make decisions to minimize the perishability of their caches, non-dormant seeds were hoarded at a lower rate, but had a higher probability of embryo removal than dormant seeds. Compared with non-mast years, a lower proportion of seeds were harvested during mast years, but a higher proportion of the harvested seeds were hoarded. In addition, the probability of embryo removal in the hoarded seeds was higher during mast years. Squirrels also dispersed seeds at shorter distances during mast years. Moreover, the interactions between mast seeding and seed germination schedule had significant effects on squirrel foraging decisions, including embryo removal.

The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey animals optimize this balance by concentrating their foraging activity at times of relatively low predation risk, as much as their energy status permits, but empirical evidence is scarce. We used a unique combination of automated telemetry, manual radiotelemetry and camera trapping to test whether activity at high risk times declined with food availability as predicted in a Neotropical forest rodent, the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata. We found that the relative risk of predation by the main predator, the ocelot, Leopardus pardalis, estimated as the ratio of ocelot to agouti activity on camera trap photographs, was up to four orders of magnitude higher between sunset and sunrise than during the rest of the day. Kills of radiotracked agoutis by ocelots during this high-risk period far exceeded expectations given agouti activity. Both telemetric monitoring of radio-tagged agoutis and camera monitoring of burrow entrances indicated that agoutis exited their burrows later at dawn, entered their burrows earlier at dusk and had lower overall activity levels when they lived in areas with higher food abundance. Thus, agoutis avoided activity during the high-risk period more strongly when access to food was higher.

However, little is known about the influence of perch characteristics and its relation to the foraging substrate, elements that influence prey-capture success. This study was conducted in parallel in Italy and Poland and is based on > 5000min of behavioural observations in the field. Our results show that perch type and foraging substrate characteristics affect the hunting behaviour of the Red-backed Shrike. The species utilises for its hunting activities mainly human-related structures. The foraging substrates most frequently used were ground (surface in cultivated, uncultivated, grassland and roads) and air; and secondarily the vegetation (mainly foliage of shrubs or trees). The average hunting success rate was 60%, but there were differences between Italy and Poland. Hunting success was highest for a combination of perch types (shrubs and foraging substrate on ground), and also from power lines in order to capture prey on roads. Although roads were less frequently used than other foraging substrates, they offered the highest hunting success. We found no effects of sex, period of day or weather conditions on hunting success. However, success rate increased during the last stages of the breeding season, i.e. during hatching and feeding of nestlings. The wide variety of preys and foraging substrates recorded in this study are typical for an opportunistic bird species. Open, warm spaces appear to constitute prime foraging habitat for the species, and some human-related structures as barbed wires, power lines and marginal hedges offer preferred support as perch-sites.

This is because wind turbines are frequently constructed in barbastelle habitats and yet there is no national guideline on how the arising conflict should be handled. We studied the movement, behavior and mortality of a barbastelle population at a wind farm in southern Sweden, using radio-telemetry, automatic bat detectors and carcass searches. The tagged bats (6 males and 8 females) roosted mainly under loose bark of dead oak trees and foraged in patches of mature deciduous woodlands or pockets of mature spruce trees within 15 km of the roosts. Extensive areas of young spruce plantation, open farmland and lakes were not used for roosting or foraging but were crossed by commuting bats. Continuous recordings with bat detectors frequently picked up barbastelles at forest edges 30 m from the turbines, but rarely over the turbine pads within 10 m from the turbines and never at heights of 30 and 100 m at the turbine towers. Barbastelles were apparently not attracted to the wind turbines and did not seem to interact with them in any way. Carcass searches under 10 wind turbines at 1-week intervals over three summers did not reveal any dead barbastelles, although three other species were recovered. We conclude that wind farming is not nessarily incompatible with effective conservation of barbastelles in Sweden, but instead of focusing on wind turbines, effors should concentrate on (a) preservation and restoration of mature, age-structured deciduous woodlands and spruce forests, including very small and isolated patches, which provide food and roosts, and probably also (b) avoidance of outdoor lighting in areas used by barbastelles. Designating large circular buffer zones around each known or suspected colony according to current practice would be inefficient or meaningless in our case, because barbastelles use extensive home ranges and switch roost frequently.

To augment bat conservation in such highly modified agro-environments, we evaluated the foraging decisions of the widely distributed Noack's round-leaf bat (Hipposideros aff. ruber) in a Ghanaian agro-environment for two factors: (a) foraging durations and (b) habitat selection from radio telemetry data collected from 13 bats. We hypothesized that it opportunistically selects foraging habitats in proportion to its availability. Our compositional analysis revealed, however, a nonrandom use of habitats.

Ares_2010,"Ares, Jorge O.; Bertiller, Monica",Modeling high-frequency position data of large herbivores with a phase-state model,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Understanding the rules and factors that drive the foraging behavior of large herbivores is important to describe their interaction with the landscape at various spatial scales. Some unresolved questions refer to landscape-behavioral interactions that result in oriented or random search in seasonally changing landscapes. Remotely sensed position data indicate that herbivores select local patches of heterogeneous landscapes depending on a complex host of dynamically varying animal and environmental conditions. Since foraging paths consist in successions of relatively short steps, increasing the frequency at which position information is acquired would contribute to entangle the mechanisms resulting in herbivores' foraging paths. We addressed the question whether herbivores would obtain information at a patch scale that would modify their distribution at a landscape scale based on directed movement or navigation ability. We considered a set of 100,000 high-frequency (1 min intervals) position data of several free-ranging sheep (Ovis aries) at a seasonal-varying range (Patagonian Monte, Argentina) and observed their movements at landscape and at single vegetation patch scales. At a landscape scale, we inspected the spatial co-variation of seasonally varying forage offer and ewes' movement speeds. At a patch scale, we developed a phase-state (P-S) model of movement cycles based on the occurrence of behavioral phases along foraging paths, and fitted it to the observed daily time series of ewes' movement speeds. Ewes were preferentially distributed in areas with high forage offer during periods of low forage availability and the reverse occurred during the season of high forage availability. Parameters of the model of activity cycles amenable to control by ewes (duration of speed phases, time elapsed between speed cycles) did not covariate with forage offer, but varied significantly among ewes. The shape (kurtosis) parameter of the model of movement cycles, one which is unlikely under ewes' control, co-varied significantly with spatial forage offer but did not differ among ewes. We conclude that ewes allocated foraging time along a series of similar movement efforts irrespective of forage availability at small patches. Average forage scarcity at multi-patch level increases the ratio of searching to feeding time. This results in apparent selective time allocation to richer forage areas but does not imply evidence for oriented movement at a landscape scale. We advance a behavioral-based definition of forage patches and discuss its implications in developing foraging theory and models. The P-S model applied to high-frequency position data of large herbivores substantially improves the interpretation of the factors controlling their time allocation in space with respect to previous models of herbivore spatial behavior by discriminating among behavioral-based and environmentally induced components of their movements.

We used fixed-kernel density to estimate the home range used by each colony and each individual. We performed a compositional analysis to determine land cover types selected by gray bats. Aerial telemetry was successful with 15 independent locations gathered for 42 individuals and an error of approximately 400m.

For African elephants Loxodonta africana, human pressures from poaching and conflict are primary drivers of species decline, but little is known about how elephants structure their spatial behavior in the face of human occupancy and predation. We seek to understand how elephants balance trade-offs between resource access, human presence and human predatory risk factors (poaching and conflict killing) in an unfenced, dynamic ecosystem where elephants persist primarily outside protected areas in community rangelands. We used tracking data from 101 elephants collected between 2001 and 2016. We investigated elephant behavior in response to landcover, topography, productivity, water, human features and human predation risk using third-order resource selection functions. We extended this analysis by employing a mixed-effects multinomial regression to identify temporal shifts in habitat use, and evaluated temporal shifts in movement patterns by estimating mean squared displacement across different productivity periods. Across periods, elephants displayed strong selection for productive areas and areas near water. Temporal shifts in habitat use showed that, during the dry period, elephants were clustered around permanent water sources where humans also congregated. At the onset of the wet period, a shift occurred where elephants moved away from permanent water and from permanent settlements towards seasonal water sources and seasonal settlements. Our findings indicate that foraging and water access are important limiting factors affecting elephants that potentially restrain their spatial responses to humans at the scale of our analysis. Given that pastoralists and elephants rely on the same resources, increasing human and livestock populations enhance pressure on shared resources and space in Africa's drylands.

Nectarivorous Hawaiian honeycreepers are believed to be highly mobile throughout the year, but their fine-scale movement patterns remain unknown. The movement behavior of these crucial pollinators has important implications for forest ecology, and for mortality from avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), an introduced disease that does not occur in high-elevation forests where Hawaiian honeycreepers primarily breed. Methods We used an automated radio telemetry network to track the movement of two Hawaiian honeycreeper species, the Modified Letter Turned Commaapapane (Himatione sanguinea) and Modified Letter Turned CommaiModified Letter Turned Commaiwi (Drepanis coccinea). We collected high temporal and spatial resolution data across the annual cycle. We identified movement strategies using a multivariate analysis of movement metrics and assessed seasonal changes in movement behavior. Results Both species exhibited multiple movement strategies including sedentary, central place foraging, commuting, and nomadism , and these movement strategies occurred simultaneously across the population. We observed a high degree of intraspecific variability at the individual and population level. The timing of the movement strategies corresponded well with regional bloom patterns of 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha) the primary nectar source for the focal species. Birds made long-distance flights, including multi-day forays outside the tracking array, but exhibited a high degree of fidelity to a core use area, even in the non-breeding period. Both species visited elevations where avian malaria can occur but exhibited little seasonal change in elevation (< 150 m) and regularly returned to high-elevation roosts at night. Conclusions This study demonstrates the power of automated telemetry to study complex and fine-scale movement behaviors in rugged tropical environments. Our work reveals a system in which birds can track shifting resources using a diverse set of movement behaviors and can facultatively respond to environmental change.

Because animals select habitats at different scales, and because the selection criteria used may be scale-dependent, studies examining the significance of food in relation to habitat selection should ideally incorporate more than one spatial scale. We relied on spatial ecology data and prey abundance estimates to examine whether prey (rodent) abundance is a consistent predictor of habitat selection at two different spatial scales in an ambush predator, the speckled rattlesnake (Crotalus mitchellii), during the mating and post-mating seasons. At the macrohabitat level, selection and avoidance of particular macrohabitats by C. mitchellii positively correlated with rodent abundance during the post-mating season. Because most snake foraging activity occurs during the post-mating season, this finding suggests that C. mitchellii selects macrohabitats that increase prey encounter rates. In contrast, rodent abundance was relatively low at the microhabitats selected by the snakes. Therefore, the higher prey abundance in C. mitchellii's preferred macrohabitat did not translate into increased access to prey at the snake microhabitats, indicating that prey distribution may not be a constant predictor of predator habitat choice across spatial scales. indirect evidence suggests that lower prey abundance at the snake microhabitats was the result of changes in rodent behaviour (e.g., avoiding or reducing activity at snake locations) to decrease predation risk.

However, intermediate outcomes occur when individuals escape intraguild (IG) interactions with non-lethal injuries. While the effects of wounds for prey include compromised mobility and increased predation risk, the consequences of similar injuries among top predators are not well understood, despite the implications for species interactions. Using an amphibian IG predator, Ambystoma opacum (Caudata: Ambystomatidae), we examined associations between non-lethal injuries and predator body size, foraging strategy, microhabitat selection, and intraspecific agonistic interactions. Wounds were common among IG predators, generally increasing in frequency throughout larval ontogeny. Non-lethal injuries were associated with differences in predator body size and behavior, with injured predators exhibiting smaller body sizes, increased use of benthic microhabitats, reduced agonistic displays, and increased risk of intraspecific aggression. While such effects were not ultimately associated with reduced foraging success, non-lethal injury could contribute to niche partitioning between injured and healthy predators via habitat selection, but injured predators likely continue to exert predatory pressure on IG and basal prey populations.

Social vigilance might be expected to play an important role in foraging groups with frequent conflicts over resources. I examined social vigilance in skimming semi-palmated sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, which exploit minute prey at the surface of the substrate using a head-down position that leaves them vulnerable to aggressive displacement by neighbours. Attacks over resources occurred frequently in skimming sandpipers. In these groups, vigilance increased when neighbours were closer, suggesting that close neighbours posed a threat and that vigilance has a non-negligible social component in skimming groups. The negative exponential distribution best fitted the empirical distribution of intervals between successive vigilance bouts during skimming. This type of distribution implies that a bout of vigilance is initiated at the same rate regardless of the time spent head down in the current skimming bout, a feature that would prevent would-be attackers from targeting sandpipers at times of predictable vulnerability. This study shows that the occurrence of threats from within the group can promote randomness in the temporal organization of vigilance. (c) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Birds that 'cry wolf'. Nature. 391:143-145.), has generated considerable interest due to its implication that the calling birds are intentionally deceiving listeners. Despite this interest, false alarms have been studied rarely and without detailed acoustical analysis. We explored whether false alarms are used by Greater Racket-tailed Drongos, which produce a distinctive set of notes when alarmed. We found that drongos did indeed make false alarms, defined as an alarm vocalization made either while the bird was on the perch or in the air, and followed within 10 s by a foraging attempt. However, the acoustic features of the call notes used, particularly of those calls made in the air, were more similar to aggressive calls, made when drongos chased each other, than to actual alarms produced when predators were present. Drongo foraging success was greater after false alarm calls than after silence or nonalarm vocalizations, and playback of false alarms in the air induced escape behavior in other species, though at a lower level than actual alarms. Thus, although drongos can use false alarms to startle other birds and gain foraging opportunities, such calls cannot be called false with certainty because they may also signal aggressive intent.

However, few studies examine both internal and environmental factors simultaneously, preventing us from drawing inferences about their relative importance during foraging. We capitalized on a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to compare the relative importance of internal state-based factors versus external environmental factors in explaining variation in marmot foraging and vigilance behavior. Results indicate that while internal factors such as baseline fecal glucocorticoid metabolites, parasite infection, and body condition influence the time allocated to both foraging and vigilance, environmental factors such as group size and habitat characteristics only explain variation in the time allocated to vigilance. Thus, our findings reveal not only the importance of considering effects of both internal and environmental factors in explaining behavioral trade-offs but also the value in evaluating the subtle ways in which factors explaining vigilance and foraging differ. Studies on foraging and vigilance typically focus either on internal or environmental factors that influence behavior. This paper makes contributions to the field by integrating both internal factors, such as parasite infection, body condition, and fecal glucocorticoid hormone levels, and external factors, such as group size and habitat characteristics, in evaluation of behavioral trade-offs. We find that foraging and vigilance are affected differently by internal and external factors.

We used gastrointestinal (G. I.) tract content analysis, GPS-based tracking information, and stable isotope profiles of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in selected tissues and major food items. Based on GPS tracking data (1-3 days), Ring-billed Gulls were categorized according to their use of three main foraging habitats: agricultural, St. Lawrence River, and anthropogenic (comprising urban areas, landfills, and wastewater treatment plant basins). Ring-billed Gulls that foraged predominantly in anthropogenic habitats exhibited significantly lower delta N-15 in blood cells and higher total C to N ratios (C:N) in liver. These lower delta N-15 and higher C:N ratios were characteristic of profiles determined in food items consumed by Ring-billed Gulls at these urbanized sites (e. g., processed foods). The strong positive correlations between delta C-13 and delta N-15 in Ring-billed Gull tissues (plasma, blood cells, and liver) that differed in isotopic turnover times, as well as the strong positive correlations in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 between tissue pairs, indicated that Ring-billed Gulls exhibited conserved dietary habits throughout the nesting period.

Flower_2012,"Flower, Tom P.; Gribble, Matthew",Kleptoparasitism by attacks versus false alarm calls in fork-tailed drongos,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Many animals steal food, termed kleptoparasitism, but attacks are frequently unsuccessful and may incur costs. Some species produce false alarm calls during kleptoparasitism, but the relative benefits of this versus physical attacks are not known. We investigated the kleptoparasitic behaviour of a population of individually recognizable and habituated fork-tailed drongos, Dicrurus adsimilis, which kleptoparasitize food using both false alarms and physical attacks. Drongos made false alarms more frequently when kleptoparasitizing small food items, probably because these can be more profitably stolen by false alarm than attack. False alarms were also more frequent when targets were larger species, which are likely to be more costly to attack since they more frequently defended food. Drongos were able to attack targets when a false alarm had failed but rarely did so, even though such attacks were no less successful than attacks when no false alarm had been made. It therefore appears that false alarms increase opportunities for kleptoparasitism because calls can be made when attacks are unprofitable. False alarm calls also appear to benefit drongos by increasing overall success in kleptoparasitism, because attacks could be made following failed false alarm calls. This is the first study to show the functional benefits of making false alarm calls, illustrating how they may be deployed strategically in kleptoparasitism when attacks would be less profitable or even unprofitable. More generally, false alarms may evolve where animals engage in physical conflict over resources because they can benefit individuals by decreasing the costs of competition.

Evolutionary game theory has been used to model kleptoparasitism, with a series of differential equation-based compartmental models providing significant theoretical insights into behavior in kleptoparasitic populations. In this paper, we apply this compartmental modeling approach to kleptoparasitic behavior in a real foraging population of urban gulls (Laridae). Field data was collected on kleptoparasitism and a model developed that incorporated the same kleptoparasitic and defensive strategies available to the study population. Two analyses were conducted: 1) An assessment of whether the density of each behavior in the population was at an equilibrium. 2) An investigation of whether individual foragers were using Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in the correct environmental conditions. The results showed the density of different behaviors in the population could be at an equilibrium at plausible values for handling time and fight duration. Individual foragers used aggressive kleptoparasitic strategies effectively in the correct environmental conditions but some individuals in those same conditions failed to defend food items. This was attributed to the population being composed of 3 species that differed in competitive ability. These competitive differences influenced the strategies that individuals were able to use.

Blanchard_2017,"Blanchard, Pierrick; Pays, Olivier; Fritz, Herve",Ticks or lions: trading between allogrooming and vigilance in maternal care,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Behavioural adjustments to predation risk may impose costs on prey species. While the vigilance eforaging conflict has been extensively investigated, other important fitness-related behaviours exclusive to scanning, such as grooming, have been overlooked. Yet, risk perception is expected to be more accurately assessed in these contexts as food-related parameters should not interfere. We studied individually recognizable impalas, Aepyceros melampus, and questioned the factors that shape maternal decision making in two exclusive components of maternal care with high benefits and costs: scanning for predators and grooming offspring to remove parasites. While studies generally infer prey alertness level, used as a proxy of risk perception, from the observed investment in vigilance, the vigilance eallogrooming context gave us the opportunity to directly assess alertness during the time spent head-up, and then to investigate its sources of variation and its consequences for allogrooming probability. We found a strong decrease in allogrooming probability when maternal alertness increased. Mothers were more alert in open (grassland) than in closed (bushland) habitats at a large scale. Increasing group size led both to lower maternal alertness and higher proportion of suckling time spent allogrooming, but only when surrounded by low vegetation, the reverse being true in high vegetation. Finally, mothers suckling female calves were more alert. Our results underline the determinant role of habitat, shaping both offspring predation risk and the relative conspicuousness or protective value of group mates. We discuss the potential fitness costs associated with the antipredatoreantiparasite trade-off faced during maternal care. Our results suggest that prey behaviours other than foraging are essential to identify factors shaping risk perception. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Laterality in behaviour is commonly used as an indicator of cerebral lateralisation, as asymmetry in actions often mirrors asymmetry in the brain. It has been predicted that species that habitually use limbs to manipulate food or resources will develop strong limb preferences, and data in a limited set of taxa support this prediction. However, relatively few species have been studied, limiting our understanding of how taxonomically widespread such behavioural asymmetries might be, and thus how such preferences evolve. Here, we test for limb preference within a new taxon, the rails, using the pukeko (Porphyrio p. melanotus), a species that frequently uses its feet while feeding. We quantified foot-use of 359 individual pukeko and found that though some individuals show preferences, there was no overall side preference at the population level - roughly equal numbers of individuals showed a left preference, a right preference, or no preference, though we detected a weak preference in adults during long-use behaviours. We also found that the strength of side preference weakened with increased observations of foot-usage. Finally, though patterns were similar when looking at brief and longer foot uses, the within-individual relationships between preference in those contexts was only significant in birds that used their feet at least five times. Together these findings question whether habitual foot use will lead to side preference and suggest that the apparent wide-spread and prevalent nature of this pattern in current literature may be due to a publication bias rather than the general presence of a relationship.

To confront alternative explanations for these patterns, we tracked vultures of three species in two very different ecosystems using high-resolution global positioning system/accelerometer tags accompanied by behavioral, genetic, and morphological data. The Levy distribution fitted the data sets reasonably well, matching expectations based on their sparsely distributed food resources; yet the fit of mixed models was considerably better, suggesting distinct movement modes operating at three different scales. Specifically, long-range forays (LRFs)rare, short-term, large-scale circular journeys that greatly exceed the typical foraging range and contribute to the tail-fatness of the movement distribution in all three speciesdo not match an optimal foraging strategy suggested by the LFFH. We also found no support for preferred weather conditions or population genetic structure as alternative explanations, so the hypothesis that LRFs represent failed breeding dispersal attempts to find mates remains our most plausible explanation at this time.

Although increased tolerance may play an important role in coexistence with humans, the mechanisms and fitness outcomes of long-term changes of tolerance are not fully understood because only a few studies have assessed individual- and population-level responses over many years. We developed a novel predictive framework to study habituation and sensitization to humans and applied it to yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) in areas of high and low human disturbance. We focused on two antipredator behaviors-time allocation to vigilance during foraging to quantify baseline vigilance levels and flight initiation distance (FID)-to quantify subsequent responsiveness to threat. We used the rate of body mass gain during the active season as a fitness outcome. Assessing 15 years' population and individual-level responses to human disturbances, marmots in highly disturbed colonies allocated more time to vigilance, but this did not change over time. FID decreased on average when they were approached more and also tended to decrease in highly disturbed colonies and over 15 years. Yet, there was individuality in FIDs; marmots that fled at greater distances became sensitized with repeated approaches. Additionally, the marmots in highly disturbed colonies gained less body mass over time compared to conspecifics in less disturbed colonies.

Here, we show that in meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the probability to act as sentinel, a cooperative vigilance behavior, was the same for typically occurring dry and wet conditions, but significantly reduced during a drought condition with almost no rain, especially in young individuals, members of small groups and groups with pups. The duration an individual stayed on sentinel guard, however, was most reduced during dry conditions. Besides reductions in sentinel behavior, the vocal coordination of foraging meerkats differed when comparing drought and wet conditions. Individuals responded more strongly to playbacks of sentinel all-clear calls and close calls, resulting in less vigilance and more foraging behavior during the drought condition.

However, females' distribution and behaviour may also be affected by the males' availability during rut. Indeed, it is challenging to disentangle female dispersion for food from female mate choice. We present the results of female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) behaviour in two manipulated herds during the peak week of the rut: one without males (MA) and one with males present (MP). Presence of males did not influence mean typical group size of females (MP herd: 10.14, MA herd: 11.85). However, females in the MA herd travelled longer daily distances (1.8km) compared to females in the MP herd (1.3km). The proportion of the time females spent feeding (~ 75%), walking (~ 16%), and standing (~ 8%) did not differ between the herds, whereas mating-related behaviour was, as expected, significantly higher in the MP herd, although it accounted for only 1.4% of their observed activity. The high proportion of time spent feeding indicates that females' movement is driven primarily by maximizing forage intake. No difference in the females' somatic body weight change during rut between the two herds indicates low cost of female mating related activities during rut.

Migrants are known to use urban habitats as stopover sites and often occur in cities at exceptional density: yet knowledge of migrant behaviour and ecology in such places is surprisingly limited. We radio-tracked ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) during stopovers in a New York City park to obtain some of the first detailed information on how landbird migrants utilize an urban habitat as a stopover site. We examined fine-scale movement patterns, home range sizes, stopover durations, and how arrival condition affected each of these metrics. During both seasons, most birds moved widely throughout the site upon presumed arrival and then either continued migration that night or settled into a more defined area on subsequent days. Area usage varied markedly among individuals during both seasons, ranging 1-16 ha. Stopover durations averaged 3.0 days (range = 1-10 days) during spring and 2.9 days (range = 1-14 days) during autumn. Spatial behaviours and stopover durations were not influenced by arrival condition during spring, and during autumn only movement rates and displacement distances were significantly (negatively) condition-related. Our findings do not support previous assumptions that urban stopover habitats are only used by migrants briefly in times of urgency when alternatives are unavailable. At least half of the birds we studied stopped over for multiple days during both seasons, and bird movements were indicative of an ability to search for, locate, and occupy suitable micro-sites.

To gain insights into the role of food availability in control of such foraging routines, we also estimated foraging activity patterns in captive godwits subjected to constant food availability. Captive and wild black-tailed godwits showed a persistent bimodal activity pattern through daylight period. Food availability had a significant effect on the intake rates, but had a subtler effect on foraging and intake rate rhythms. Temperature and wind speed (combined in a weather index) showed non-significant effects on both rhythms.

There are two theories for diurnal migration: (1) diurnal migration allows for the use of thermals and therefore reduces energy loss, and (2) the fly-and-forage hypothesis, which suggests that diurnal migrants can search for prey and forage as they migrate. We investigated whether American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) engage in the fly-and-forage strategy of diurnal migration as they migrated north in the spring. We tracked eight radio-tagged crows as they migrated hundreds of kilometers in the spring to determine if they were diurnal migrants, whether they migrated with conspecifics, whether they stopped to forage, and if they did stop, whether they forage with conspecifics. All crows migrated during the day, and while on several occasions crows were seen migrating in close association with conspecifics, all crows were also observed migrating alone. On average, crows migrated approximately 300 km the day they left their wintering grounds, and over the course of this day, they stopped twice and foraged at these locations for 35 min. On all but one occasion, the stops made during migration were to forage with groups of conspecifics.

An individual's fuel stores are considered in theory to directly dictate subsequent stopover behavior (e.g., extent of foraging or vigilance, when to depart), although such decisions at stopover must also consider atmospheric factors (e.g., wind, precipitation) that influence the energetic costs of migration. We conducted the first study to date that directly manipulated the fuel stores of newly arrived songbirds at a stopover site, evaluated their effect on movement behavior and departure decisions, and assessed how atmospheric factors mediated these behavioral decisions. Hermit thrushes (Catharus guttatus) captured during fall migration at a southern New England, USA, offshore island stopover site and subsequently released with increased fuel stores moved less and made more tortuous movements, were more likely to depart on a given night and regularly resumed migration earlier and in a seasonally appropriate direction relative to individuals released with little change in fuel stores. The importance of fuel stores in modifying behavioral decisions increased throughout the migration period, presumably in response to declining food abundance. Precipitation suppressed migrant movements during stopover and precluded departure. Migrants departed in light winds with little respect to wind direction. The pervasive influence of fuel stores on migrant stopover behavior underscores the central role of fuel acquisition in the dynamics, speed, and success of migration, as well as the importance of quality stopover sites to migratory birds.Songbirds typically punctuate migration with stopovers to rest and refuel. During stopover, migrants must balance finding food and staying safe, suggesting that fuel (fat) reserves govern behavioral priorities. We experimentally manipulated the fat stores of hermit thrushes newly arrived to a stopover site. Thrushes with larger fat stores moved less, resumed migration sooner, and used a more direct route than individuals with smaller fat stores; environmental conditions additionally modified thrush movements and departure decisions.",2014,10.1093/beheco/aru148,yes,ethology,exp,Catharus_guttatus,passerine,bird,radio_tracking,50,25,,123.9242685,4,BC,yes,resting,"migratory_stopover, activity_budget, movement","thrushes were temporarily held in captivity and fed, but then bserved upon release to see what they did depending ontheir energy balance",

While long-distance migratory flights represent a large energy investment, stopover accounts for roughly two-thirds of a bird's total energy expenditure during migration. Therefore, birds should minimize energy expenditure while also minimizing time and predation risk during stopover. To understand activity during migration, we recorded activity patterns (i.e. fine-scale movements associated with a range of behaviors) of 3 species, Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), at a stopover site along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico during autumn migration using automated radio telemetry. We found Red-eyed Vireos to be the most active and Swainson's Thrushes the least active. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to investigate associations between activity and factors known to influence bird behavior during stopover. While species differed, day of year and temperature were important predictors of activity for all species. Vireos were active early in the season, under light winds and warmer temperatures, and on evenings when winds were more favorable. Thrushes were more active as the season progressed and when temperatures were cooler. Thrush activity also differed between years, although thrushes increased activity later in the season during all years.

Stopover and other en route behaviors allow animals to rest and replenish energy stores and avoid or mitigate other hazards during migration. Some animals, such as soaring birds, can subsidize the energetic costs of migration by extracting energy from flowing air. However, it is unclear how these energy sources affect or interact with behavioral processes and stopover in long-distance soaring migrants. To understand these behaviors and the effects of processes that might enhance use of flight subsidies, we developed a flexible mechanistic model to predict how flight subsidies drive migrant behavior and movement processes. The novel modeling framework incorporated time-varying parameters informed by environmental covariates to characterize a continuous range of behaviors during migration. This model framework was fit to GPS satellite telemetry data collected from a large soaring and opportunist foraging bird, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), during migration in western North America. Fitted dynamic model parameters revealed a clear circadian rhythm in eagle movement and behavior, which was directly related to thermal uplift. Behavioral budgets were complex, however, with evidence for a joint migrating/foraging behavior, resembling a slower paced fly-andforage migration, which could facilitate efficient refueling while still ensuring migration progress. In previous work, ecological and foraging conditions are usually considered to be the key aspects of stopover location quality, but taxa, such as the golden eagle, that can tap energy sources from moving fluids to drive migratory locomotion may pace migration based on both foraging opportunities and available flight subsidies.",2019,10.3389/fevo.2019.00317,yes,remote,obs,Aquila_chrysaetos,raptor,bird,GPS,26,1600000,,420,70,C,yes,movement,"migratory_stopover, behavioural_state, activity_budget",remotely sensed foraging vs. travelling behaviour during fall & spring migration from alaska to new mexico,

Some bat species make long-distance latitudinal migrations between summer and winter grounds, but because of their elusive nature, few aspects of their biology are well understood. The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats. 2. We studied migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio-transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (c. 20 x 40 km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long-distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate. 3. Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid-September). Most bats stayed 1-2 days, although two remained >2 weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimumcrossing distance c. 38 km) while half departed along the shoreline. 4. Simulations predicted a migration rate of c. 250-275 km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500 km) without further refuelling. 5. Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short-term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds.

The rate at which they can fuel is likely to be strongly influenced by a range of factors, such as physiology, food availability, time available for foraging and perceived predation. We analysed the foraging behaviour and fuel accumulation of pink-footed geese, an Arctic capital breeder, at their mid-flyway spring stopover site and evaluated to what extent their behaviour and fuelling were related to physiological and external factors and how it differed from other stopovers along the flyway. We found that fuel accumulation rates of geese at the mid-flyway site were limited by habitat availability rather than by digestive constraints. However, as the time available for foraging increased over the stopover season, geese were able to keep constant fuelling rate. Putting this in perspective, geese increased their daily net energy intake along the flyway corresponding to the increase in time available for foraging. The net energy intake per hour of foraging remained the same. Geese showed differences in their reaction to predators/disturbance between the sites, taking higher risks particularly at the final stopover site. Hence, perceived predation along the flyway may force birds to postpone the final fuel accumulation to the last stopover along the flyway. Flexibility in behaviour appears to be an important trait to ensure fitness in this capital breeder.

In order to fill a knowledge gap in the pre-migratory behaviour of purple herons Ardea purpurea, a species conducting a 3,500-4,000 km migration journey within 5-7 days, 12 adult and four juvenile purple herons were equipped with satellite transmitters in The Netherlands.

Based on the recorded positions, the location and the size of pre-migratory feeding areas were identified, as well as the duration herons used these sites. In addition, the location of and the distance flown to and from night roosts could also be defined. The results revealed that failed breeders started migration at the same time as successful breeders resulting in a longer pre-migratory period. After fledging, juveniles showed an initial search period before settling down at a final pre-migratory site, which resulted in later departure to Africa compared with adults. Most of the dusk- and daylight period (amounting altogether to 15-18 hours) was spent at the feeding sites. After breeding, most adults remained to use the same feeding areas but switched from sleeping in the colony to night roosts within feeding areas, likely to minimize the daily flight costs.

At the patch scale, we found that birds preferred dogwood-willow swamp, low-lying forest patches, and areas of greater habitat complexity for foraging in both seasons. At the fine scale, spring migrants foraged closer to habitat edges than random, and preferred areas with more wet leaf litter and shallow water, and less grass cover. Fall migrants also preferred shallow water and leaf litter cover, and avoided areas with dense grass, forbs, and herbaceous shrub cover.

We detected 4 distinct activity tactics, with a high degree of individual fidelity to a given tactic. Demographic factors, availability of key foraging habitat, and human disturbance were important determinants of activity tactics. Younger individuals and those with higher bear and road densities within their home range were more nocturnal and more likely to rest during the day. Good foraging habitat and increasing age led to more diurnal activity patterns and nocturnal resting periods.

The method entails fitting mixtures of component statistical distributions to the frequency distribution of hourly step displacements. Breakpoints indicating transitions between predominant movement modes were identified by fitting exponential segments. Breakpoints were incorporated as off-sets for gamma distributions, but not needed for log-normal distributions. This procedure was applied to movement data for three large grazing ungulates. Key results. Models consistently distinguished four movement modes interpreted as representing resting, foraging, mixed movement and travelling activity. Breakpoints and parameter estimates were consistent among seasons and herds of each ungulate species. The exponential-segment model and both mixture models closely represented observed daily activity patterns.

Waterfowl are key players in ecological processes in wetlands and surrounding habitats through predator-prey interactions and their transportation of nutrients and other organisms. Understanding the drivers of their movement behaviour is crucial to predict how environmental changes affect their role in ecosystem functioning. Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) are the most abundant duck species worldwide and important dispersers of aquatic invertebrates, plants and pathogens like avian influenza viruses. By GPS tracking of 97 mallards in four landscape types along a gradient of wetland availability, we identified patterns in their daily movement behaviour and quantified potential effects of weather conditions and water availability on the spatial scale of their movements. Results: We demonstrate that mallard movement patterns were highly predictable, with regular commuting flights at dusk and dawn between a fixed day roost and one or several fixed nocturnal foraging sites, linked strongly to surface water. Wind and precipitation hardly affected movement, but flight distances and home range sizes increased when temperatures dropped towards zero. Flight distances and home range sizes increased exponentially with decreasing availability of freshwater habitat. Total shoreline length and the number of water bodies in the landscape surrounding the roost were the best predictors of the spatial scale of daily mallard movements. Conclusions: Our results show how mallards may flexibly adjust the spatial scale of their movements to wetland availability in the landscape. This implies that mallards moving between discrete habitat patches continue to preserve biotic connectivity in increasingly fragmented landscapes. The high predictability of mallard movement behaviour in relation to landscape features makes them reliable dispersal vectors for organisms to adapt to, and allows prediction of their ecological role in other landscapes.",2017,10.1186/s40462-016-0092-7,yes,remote,obs,Anas_platyrhynchos,waterfowl,bird,GPS,97,78.53981634,,1200,17.08247423,BC,yes,resting,"movement, habitat_selection, circadian_activity","15min GPS fixes, roosting vs. foraging vs. commuting habitats identified from step lengths",
Owen-Smith_2015,"Owen-Smith, Norman; Martin, Jodie; Yoganand, K.",Spatially nested niche partitioning between syntopic grazers at foraging arena scale within overlapping home ranges,ECOSPHERE,"Niche separation among species with similar resource requirements can be expressed at various spatiotemporal scales, from the resource components selected at feeding sites to habitat and home range occupation and ultimately geographic distribution ranges. African large herbivores present a challenge to niche theory because multiple species commonly overlap both spatially and in vegetation components consumed. Aided by GPS telemetry, we investigated the space use patterns of two large grazers that are frequently associated in mixed-species aggregations. Specifically, we compared a generalist grazer with hindgut fermentation (plains zebra) with a similar-sized grazing ruminant (blue wildebeest) in west-central Kruger National Park, South Africa. We found that herds of the two species overlapped substantially in the home ranges that they occupied, but exploited spatially distinct foraging arenas for periods lasting several days or weeks within these ranges. Moreover, wildebeest and zebra differed in duration of settlement, extent of areas occupied during settlement, consequent exploitation intensity per unit area, proportion of time spent within foraging arenas relative to roaming interludes, and movement rates while within these arenas. In particular, wildebeest herds concentrated within small areas for prolonged periods, while zebra herds used more foraging arenas but exploited them for briefer periods. Both species overlapped substantially in habitat use, although wildebeest more strongly favored gabbro uplands and sodic sites presenting short grass lawns while zebra made greater use of areas with a taller grass cover. Hence resource partitioning was expressed mainly through behavioral distinctions in patch exploitation at foraging arena scale rather than in home range or habitat separation. Although zebra may have been partially excluded from the grasslands kept short by wildebeest, these sites formed only a small part of the wider ranges utilized by zebra, thereby restricting the competitive consequences. Hence spatially nested resource partitioning of this form contributes to the coexistence of these two grazers, and may be a mechanism enabling niche separation among other species.",2015,10.1890/ES14-00487.1,yes,remote,obs,Connochaetes_taurinus,ungulate,mammal,GPS,12,535,,1460,365,C,yes,resting,"movement, habitat_selection, competition, heterospecific, inferred_foraging",,

Little is currently understood about its movements and habitat use during the nonbreeding season. The objectives of this research were to identify habitats preferred by two subpopulations of the Nene and how preferences shift seasonally at both meso- and fine scales. From 2009 to 2011, ten Nene ganders were outfitted with 40- to 45-g satellite transmitters with GPS capability. We used binary logistic regression to compare habitat use versus availability and an information-theoretic approach for model selection. Meso-scale habitat modeling revealed that Nene preferred exotic grass and human-modified landscapes during the breeding and molting seasons and native subalpine shrubland during the nonbreeding season. Fine-scale habitat modeling further indicated preference for exotic grass, bunch grass, and absence of trees. Proximity to water was important during molt, suggesting that the presence of water may provide escape from introduced mammalian predators while Nene are flightless. Fine-scale species-composition data added relatively little to understanding of Nene habitat preferences modeled at the meso scale, suggesting that the meso-scale is appropriate for management planning. Habitat selection during our study was consistent with historical records, although dissimilar from more recent studies of other subpopulations.

For the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos), the hunting season coincides with the period of hyperphagia. Hunting mortality risk is not uniformly distributed throughout the day, but peaks in the early morning hours. As bears must increase mass for winter survival, they should be sensitive to temporal allocation of antipredator responses to periods of highest risk. We expected bears to reduce foraging activity at the expense of food intake in the morning hours when risk was high, but not in the afternoon, when risk was low. We used fine-scale GPS-derived activity patterns during the 2 weeks before and after the onset of the annual bear hunting season. At locations of probable foraging, we assessed abundance and sugar content, of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), the most important autumn food resource for bears in this area. Bears decreased their foraging activity in the morning hours of the hunting season. Likewise, they foraged less efficiently and on poorer quality berries in the morning. Neither of our foraging measures were affected by hunting in the afternoon foraging bout, indicating that bears did not allocate antipredator behavior to times of comparably lower risk. Bears effectively responded to variation in risk on the scale of hours. This entailed a measurable foraging cost. The additive effect of reduced foraging activity, reduced forage intake, and lower quality food may result in poorer body condition upon den entry and may ultimately reduce reproductive success.",2016,10.1007/s00442-016-3729-8,yes,remote,obs,Ursus_arctos,carnivore,mammal,GPS,7,n/a,,192,28,BC,yes,resting,"movement, habitat_selection, inferred_foraging, behavioural_state",,

Tracking the movements of wild platypuses has been notoriously difficult due to the animals' morphology and methodological limitations. Knowledge of fine-scale movements and interactions among individuals remain particularly poorly understood, as do responses to changes in hydrology. We tracked movements of 15 platypuses (six females, nine males) downstream of the Jindabyne Dam on the Snowy River, using externally attached acoustic transmitters (September-November 2017), to assess spatio-temporal activity patterns among individuals and changes in movement and activity before and after an environmental flushing flow. As the study took place during the breeding season, we expected to observe overlap in area of activity among males and females, but not among males due to increased territoriality during these months. We also anticipated that a large flow event would impact their activity and foraging behaviour, possibly displacing platypuses downstream. Overlaps in area of activity and temporal co-occurrence within a pool varied among individuals, with two resident males exhibiting some spatial overlap of activity and varying temporal co-occurrence, despite tracking during the breeding season. All six tracked females were captured in the same pool and appeared to be residents, possibly highlighting preferences for certain habitats during the breeding months. We found no evidence that the movements of adult platypuses were affected by an environmental flushing flow, with no significant changes to area of activity, number of detections, or daily range of movements. However, foraging duration increased in the week after the flow, possibly associated with increased prey availability.

The endemic Mauritian flying fox (Pteropus niger) has recently been subjected to large-scale culling because of perceived damage to commercial fruit, and a consequent reduction in numbers of >50% since 2015 resulted in its IUCN Red List Status being up-listed to Endangered. Determining its movements will be important for management and conservation, for understanding potential responses to environmental change, and for understanding population admixture. Methods: Twelve bats were tagged with solar-powered GPS/GSM devices in 2014-2016. Tags remained active for up to almost a year (maximum 359 days: average 139 days (males) and 93 days (females)), providing some of the longest-term data on the movement ecology of bats yet obtained. Eight bats were probably hunted illegally, highlighting the scale of unauthorised persecution. Results: Males travelled on average 9 km each night, females 6 km. The nightly distance covered by adults of both sexes was higher in winter than in summer, though the opposite pattern occurred for immature males. These differences are probably related to seasonal changes in fruit availability (adults) and to dispersal by immature males. The maximum distance covered during one night was >92 km. Home ranges of males averaged 74,633 ha, females 31,072 ha. Core foraging areas averaged 2222 ha for males, 1364 ha for females. Fifty roosts were identified, mainly in forest fragments. As the bats disperse seeds of native plants that form forest canopies, conservation of the bats will potentially maintain and enhance native forest cover, in turn providing roosting sites for the bats. Conclusions: Solar-powered GSM tagging provides unprecedented potential for understanding the movement ecology of flying foxes. Mauritian flying foxes often move between the few remnant native forest fragments, which remain important for their conservation, and have potentially important roles in seed dispersal. Their nomadic movement fits with their panmictic genetic structure.

A few empirical studies have examined the consequences of personality differences on captive-bred translocated animals, but this has not been done for wild-caught animals. We compared behavioral responses to trapping, processing, holding, and release for 56 wild common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Twenty individuals were captured twice, once to attach radio-tracking collars, the second time (2 weeks later) for the translocation. Consistency of behavioral responses was compared between capture events and radio-tracking allowed estimates of pretranslocation home range, rest site selection, and foraging behavior. Survivors (n = 10 survivors, 5 months later) were individuals showing the most fear or emotional reactivity during holding (less likely to have slept, eaten, defecated, or nested) and those that had the smallest home ranges and selected the safest den sites in their original habitat. Conversely, the greatest increase in body mass was recorded for individuals that had demonstrated unsafe behavior in their original habitat.

In the Arctic, the short summers are crucial for replenishing body reserves, while low food availability and increased energetic demands characterise the long winters (9-10 months). Under such extreme seasonal variability, even small deviations from optimal time allocation can markedly impact individuals' condition, reproductive success and survival. We investigated which environmental conditions influenced daily, seasonal, and interannual variation in time allocation in high-arctic muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) and evaluated whether results support qualitative predictions derived from upscaled optimal foraging theory. Methods Using hidden Markov models (HMMs), we inferred behavioural states (foraging, resting, relocating) from hourly positions of GPS-collared females tracked in northeast Greenland (28 muskox-years). To relate behavioural variation to environmental conditions, we considered a wide range of spatially and/or temporally explicit covariates in the HMMs. Results While we found little interannual variation, daily and seasonal time allocation varied markedly. Scheduling of daily activities was distinct throughout the year except for the period of continuous daylight. During summer, muskoxen spent about 69% of time foraging and 19% resting, without environmental constraints on foraging activity. During winter, time spent foraging decreased to 45%, whereas about 43% of time was spent resting, mediated by longer resting bouts than during summer. Conclusions Our results clearly indicate that female muskoxen follow an energy intake maximisation strategy during the arctic summer. During winter, our results were not easily reconcilable with just one dominant foraging strategy. The overall reduction in activity likely reflects higher time requirements for rumination in response to the reduction of forage quality (supporting an energy intake maximisation strategy). However, deep snow and low temperatures were apparent constraints to winter foraging, hence also suggesting attempts to conserve energy (net energy maximisation strategy).

We analyzed the speed of approach to natural trees of wild capuchin monkeys under the effect of scramble competition, after excluding any plausible visual, olfactory and auditory cues. We conducted all-day group follows of three habituated capuchin groups at IguazA National Park, Argentina, collecting data on ranging behavior and patterns of visits to fruit trees in relation with their location and fruit availability. Travel speed varied according to the expected reward at a feeding tree, increasing as rewards increased from low values, but decreasing again at very high values. Also, travel speed varied with time of day, decreasing from the time of first activity as the monkeys became less hungry, and increasing again toward late afternoon. Measures of unripe fruit cover did not explain variation in travel speed at any distance from a focal tree.

For terrestrial mammals, one of the principal problems is the risk associated with moving through the environment while foraging. We examined nocturnal patterns of movement of urban-dwelling hedgehogs in relation to (1) the risks posed by predators and motor vehicles and (2) nightly weather patterns. Hedgehogs preferentially utilized the gardens of semidetached and terraced houses. However, females, but not males, avoided the larger back gardens of detached houses, which contain more of the habitat features selected by badgers. This difference in the avoidance of predation risk is probably associated with sex differences in breeding behaviour. Differences in nightly movement patterns were consistent with strategies associated with mating behaviour and the accumulation of fat reserves for hibernation. Hedgehogs also differed in behaviour associated with the risks posed by humans; they avoided actively foraging near roads and road verges, but did not avoid crossing roads per se. They were, however, significantly more active after midnight when there was a marked reduction in vehicle and foot traffic. In particular, responses to increased temperature, which is associated with increased abundance of invertebrate prey, were only observed after midnight. This variation in the timing of bouts of activity would reduce the risks associated with human activities. There were also profound differences in both area ranged and activity between years which warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, in pteropodid bats, this behaviour has not been reported. Here, we document geophagy behaviour by the pteropodid bat, Cynopterus sphinx, during foraging in the fruiting trees of Madhuca latifolia (Sapotaceae). These bats removed single fruits from the foraging tree and carried it to the feeding roost for consumption. At around 1900 h, we observed three individuals of C. sphinx gleaning over the ground surface by circling flights. The bats landed with their wings spread apart and started licking the soil with head movements. Their ventral body surface rested completely on the ground while consuming the soil. A total of 91 feeding bouts of soil consumption were recorded within 1 h; however, thereafter, this behaviour was not observed. In order to understand the function of geophagy, we quantitatively analysed the composition of minerals in the soil, as well as in the M. latifolia fruits (partially ripe) along with its secondary metabolites from the study site. Our results revealed that the partially ripe fruits contained high levels of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, tannins, coumarins and saponins).

The time brown hyenas spent at the seal colony decreased with increasing seal density and increasing air temperatures. Nevertheless, they were regularly active during the day when less adult seals were present at the colony, which indicates that the attendance of adult seals might play a role in the choice of foraging time. Brown hyenas killed seal pups throughout the study period. The predation rate was independent of the availability of non-violent mortalities, but the absolute number of kills was positively density-dependent.

We show that the squirrel preys on seeds defecated by lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) in the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. The squirrel consumed seeds in tapir feces at a latrine, including Spondias macrocarpa, S. venulosa and Elaeis guineensis. In videos and photographs taken by a camera trap, squirrels are clearly seen removing and eating seeds from tapir fecal pellets. Squirrels are known to be both seed dispersers (primary and secondary) and predators, and seed dispersal and predation are important for plant community structure. We demonstrate that as seed predators, squirrels seems to monitor and opportunistically take advantage of seeds dispersed by other mammals, thereby reducing primary dispersal effectiveness and compromising the ecosystem service provided by other dispersers. Squirrels may take advantage of latrines when other food sources are locally unavailable. Also, tapirs, because they travel large distances while foraging, often predictably return to latrines, thereby providing squirrels with an otherwise unavailable resource. If seeds become very abundant in latrines, perhaps squirrels then hoard (secondary dispersal) the excess. If the behavior described is a general trend, the pattern is likely to be often repeated, especially in tropical forests with similar mammalian assemblages, and this complex dynamic will require further study to better understand consequences of post-dispersal seed predation.",2017,,yes,camera traps,obs,Guerlinguetus_ingrami,rodent,mammal,camera_trap,n/a,1 point,27,,27,A,no,n/a,natural_history,"trap camera wasn't baited, but was set at tapir latrine to see if squirrels forage for seeds in their feces",
Krauss_2018,"Krauss, Siegfried L.; Roberts, David G.; Phillips, Ryan D.; Edwards, Caroline",Effectiveness of camera traps for quantifying daytime and nighttime visitation by vertebrate pollinators,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Identification of pollen vectors is a fundamental objective of pollination biology. The foraging and social behavior of these pollinators has profound effects on plant mating, making quantification of their behavior critical for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of different pollinators for the plants they visit. However, accurate quantification of visitation may be problematic, especially for shy animals and/or when the temporal and spatial scale of observation desired is large. Sophisticated heat- and movement-triggered motion-sensor cameras (camera trapping) provide new, underutilized tools to address these challenges. However, to date, there has been no rigorous evaluation of the sampling considerations needed for using camera trapping in pollination research. We measured the effectiveness of camera trapping for identifying vertebrate visitors and quantifying their visitation rates and foraging behavior on Banksia menziesii (Proteaceae). Multiple still cameras (Reconyx HC 500) and a video camera (Little Acorn LTL5210A) were deployed. From 2,753 recorded visits by vertebrates, we identified five species of nectarivorous honeyeater (Meliphagidae) and the honey possum (Tarsipedidae), with significant variation in the species composition of visitors among inflorescences. Species of floral visitor showed significant variation in their time of peak activity, duration of visits, and numbers of flowers probed per visit. Where multiple cameras were deployed on individual inflorescences, effectiveness of individual still cameras varied from 15% to 86% of all recorded visits. Methodological issues and solutions, and the future uses of camera traps in pollination biology, are discussed.Conclusions and wider implications: Motion-triggered cameras are promising tools for the quantification of vertebrate visitation and some aspects of behavior on flowers. However, researchers need to be mindful of the variation in effectiveness of individual camera traps in detecting animals.

We studied nest-site selection and nest success of the understory-nesting Scaly-crowned Babbler (Malacopteron cinereum) in a seasonal evergreen forest in northeastern Thailand during four breeding seasons. We identified nest predators using video-monitoring and examined relationships between nest site vegetation structure and nest predation by dominant predators. Based on 71 video-monitored nests, 98.5% of failures were due to predation; 59 predation events from nine predator species were documented including Northern Pig-tailed Macaque (Macaca leonina) (47.5%, n = 28), five avian predator species (32.2%, n = 19), and two snake species (18.6%, n = 11). Nest sites had significantly higher concealment and number of lianas than random sites. Higher concealment may represent selection against visually oriented predators which were responsible for approximately 80% of predation events. Vegetation parameters suggested opposing patterns for macaques versus snakes; nests surrounded by higher density of saplings and lower density of taller stems (5-10 m) were depredated by macaques, whereas snake depredated nests were associated with a lower density of saplings, a higher density of taller stems and a higher density of lianas. Nests depredated by avian predators were not associated with any measured variables. Our data suggest that different vegetation structures perhaps facilitate or impede different predators and different predators may generate conflicting selection pressures for nesting birds within a given habitat.

Forty-spotted Pardalotes forage predominantly in the foliage of White (or Manna) Gums Eucalyptus viminalis for invertebrates, lerps (the protective coverings produced by psyllids) and manna, a crystallized exudate produced by certain Eucalyptus species. Although many Australian birds feed on manna, this study reports the first observations of birds actively stimulating manna production rather than feeding on it opportunistically. In light of these observations, we also compared rates of manna production across tree species and sizes, and quantified the relative importance of manna in nestling diet. Adult Forty-spotted Pardalotes stimulated manna production by clipping leaf stalks with their bills, creating small incisions in the stem surface. We experimentally mimicked this behaviour and found that, in 53.7% of incisions of E. viminalis, manna flow was released within 3days. However, none of the other three common tree species at our sites produced manna in response to the same experimental damage. There was no effect of tree size on manna production by E. viminalis. To determine the importance of manna and other food sources in nestling diet, we videotaped provisioning trips by adults to nests and surveyed food availability in E. viminalis foliage within territories. Manna was the most important food item, comprising 84.2% of identified food items provided to nestlings, and it was selected over 50 times more frequently than expected given its relative availability in the foliage. As a manna miner, the Forty-spotted Pardalote is the first Australian bird to join the small number of bird species that mine sap or other exudates of trees. Their preference for manna as a food source, especially in nestling diet, provides an explanation for the species' specialization on E. viminalis, the only manna-producing tree at our sites. Our results suggest that E. viminalis forests provide critical food supply for developing nestlings, and that restoration of E. viminalis forests will be critical to the long-term viability of Forty-spotted Pardalote populations.",2016,10.1111/ibi.12350,yes,audio video_ethology,obs,Pardalotus_quadragintus,passerine,bird,"direct_obs, camera_trap",12,0.71,0.833333333,,32,AB,no,nest_attendance,"natural_history, nest_provisioning","did direct obs of birds in trees, but no report of for how long or how many, that was just descriptive; 20h of nest cam footage",

Some animals exhibit movement recursions to locations that are tied to reproductive functions, including nests and dens; while existing literature recognizes that, no method is currently available to explicitly target different types of revisited locations. Moreover, the temporal persistence of recursive movements to a breeding location can carry information regarding the fate of breeding attempts, but it has never been used as a metric to quantify recursive movement patterns. Here, we introduce a method to locate breeding attempts and estimate their fate from GPS-tracking data of central place foragers. We tested the performance of our method in three bird species differing in breeding ecology (wood stork (Mycteria americana), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), Mediterranean gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus)) and implemented it in the R package 'nestR'. Methods We identified breeding sites based on the analysis of recursive movements within individual tracks. Using trajectories with known breeding attempts, we estimated a set of species-specific criteria for the identification of nest sites, which we further validated using non-reproductive individuals as controls. We then estimated individual nest survival as a binary measure of reproductive fate (success, corresponding to fledging of at least one chick, or failure) from nest-site revisitation histories during breeding attempts, using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach that accounted for temporally variable revisitation patterns, probability of visit detection, and missing data. Results Across the three species, positive predictive value of the nest-site detection algorithm varied between 87 and 100% and sensitivity between 88 and 92%, and we correctly estimated the fate of 86-100% breeding attempts. Conclusions By providing a method to formally distinguish among revisited locations that serve different ecological functions and introducing a probabilistic framework to quantify temporal persistence of movement recursions, we demonstrated how the analysis of recursive movement patterns can be applied to estimate reproduction in central place foragers. Beyond avian species, the principles of our method can be applied to other central place foraging breeders such as denning mammals. Our method estimates a component of individual fitness from movement data and will help bridge the gap between movement behavior, environmental factors, and their fitness consequences.",2020,10.1186/s40462-020-00201-1,yes,remote,obs,"Mycteria_americana, Falco_naumanni, Ichthyaetus_melanocephalus","charadriform, heron, raptor",bird,GPS,233,n/a,110,,110,BC,yes,nest_attendance,"nest_attendance, survival_modeling","using temporal range of how long birds return to the same central place as evidence for nest survival - if they stop coming back too early, probably the chicks died?",

To identify the most important micro- and macrohabitat landscape characteristics that are important factors for birds when choosing foraging patches in their territory, we used a radio-telemetric approach with nestling-feeding great tit (Parus major) females in a heterogeneous habitat mosaic. We showed that birds preferred to forage in areas with low or high but not mid-range normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, similarly in coniferous and deciduous forests. At the same time, foraging birds avoided areas with low or high but not mid-range canopy cover only in the dense deciduous forest, whereas in the more open coniferous forest, females used areas, which vary widely in the amount of canopy coverage. Females employing this foraging behaviour raised larger broods on average.

The study was conducted in an intensively cultivated area that belongs to a Special Protected Area of the Natura 2000 network in central Greece. Diet composition (prey type and size) was not affected by the recording method, the sex of adults, the brood size, the period of the day or the age of nestlings. Tettigoniidae was the most frequent prey delivered by adults. Our results from both methods showed that males delivered more prey items than females, supporting the general consensus of reversed sexual dimorphism for the Lesser Kestrel. The provisioning rate was not significantly related to brood size, but it was affected by the method of observation, parent sex and the interaction of method and nestling age. According to the direct observations, provisioning rates increased as nestlings grew up, while they decreased based on camera information. Higher provisioning rates recorded in direct observations at later nestling stages, can be explained by higher food requirements of nestlings.

In pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), naive dispersers (immigrants) had a more generalist diet and higher feeding rates compared with philopatric birds, but we found no difference in level of aggression.

Dispersers are often a nonrandom sample of the population, and differ consistently from nondispersers in a suite of correlated phenotypic traits (dispersal syndromes). This phenotypic integration is thought to be adaptive. Here, we investigate whether dispersal tendency of individual pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) covaries with a set of repeatable behaviors that should confer advantages for surviving and reproducing in novel environments. We specifically focus on the link between dispersal, foraging behavior, and aggressiveness because selection on foraging tactics or social behaviors likely differs between individuals staying in familiar or dispersing to novel environments. Using repeated measures of nestling provisioning data of pied flycatcher parents in 1 year, we tested if immigrants and philopatric individuals (local recruits and experienced breeders) differed in diet specialization, provisioning rates, levels of aggression, and reproductive success. Results show that individuals differed consistently in their foraging behavior, with immigrants having a more generalist diet and higher feeding rates than philopatric birds, but not in aggressiveness. More generalist males fledged more young. Our findings suggest that prior local knowledge facilitates diet specialization, and that more generalist diets could be adaptive for immigrants breeding in unknown environments. Aggressiveness was not part of the dispersal syndrome in our population, perhaps because high aggression levels are too costly to maintain in high density populations. Understanding the proximate causes and ultimate consequences of variation in dispersal syndromes requires now experimental manipulations of individual dispersal decisions.",2019,10.1093/beheco/ary152,yes,ethology,obs,Ficedula_hypoleuca,passerine,bird,camera_trap,58,5,0.083333333,,9,A,yes,nest_attendance,nest_provisioning,"camera in nest box showing what parents bring back, but not them actively foraging",
Lu_2011,"Lu, Xin; Yu, Tonglei; Ke, Dianhua",Helped ground tit parents in poor foraging environments reduce provisioning effort despite nestling starvation,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Life history theory views parental effort as a dynamic response to current productivity benefits and personal survival costs. Classical provisioning models specific to avian cooperative breeding systems predict that nestling starvation caused by local food limitation will induce helped parents to maintain their effort to ensure fledging success. Yet, food shortages may impose such a high provisioning cost that selection favours parents that lighten their workload at the expense of offspring productivity. We tested this alternative prediction with the ground tit, Parus humilis, which is an insectivorous, facultative cooperative breeder; helpers are mostly philopatric male offspring. Our study was based on data from three breeding seasons over which rainfall, and hence food resources, varied greatly. Total amount of food delivered to the young was highest for group-fed broods in food-rich environments, although helped male and female parents invested less than their counterparts with no helpers, and provisioning rate of the latter in both types of environmental conditions was similar to that of group-fed broods in food-poor environments. The variation in care level was mirrored by the observed pattern of partial brood loss, the single largest cause limiting productivity. The lowered effort in association with increased brood reduction under poor foraging conditions suggests ground tit parents with helpers trade future fitness against current reproduction to cope with harsh, unpredictable environments. This finding broadens our understanding of interspecific variability of parental response to the presence of helpers across ecological gradients.

Ants frequently become established in new areas after being transported by humans across traditional biological or geographical barriers, and a prime example of such establishment is the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). Introduced to North America in the 1930s, red imported fire ants are now firmly established throughout the southeastern United States. Although these invasive predators can dramatically impact native arthropods, their effect on vertebrates through resource competition is essentially unknown. Using a paired experimental design, we compared patterns of foraging and rates of provisioning for breeding eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) in unmanipulated (control) territories to those in adjacent (treated) territories where fire ants were experimentally reduced. Bluebirds inhabiting treated territories foraged nearer their nests and provisioned offspring more frequently than bluebirds inhabiting control territories with unmanipulated fire ant levels. Additionally, nestlings from treated territories were in better condition than those from control territories, though these differences were largely confined to early development. The elimination of significant differences in body condition toward the end of the nestling period suggests that bluebird parents in control territories were able to make up the food deficit caused by fire ants, potentially by working harder to adequately provision their offspring. The relationship between fire ant abundance and bluebird behavior hints at the complexity of ecological communities and suggests negative effects of invasive species are not limited to taxa with which they have direct contact.",2012,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2012.02076.x,yes,audio video_ethology,exp,Sialia_sialis,passerine,bird,direct_obs,20,,0.070833333,,120,B,yes,nest_attendance,nest_provisioning,"manipulated presence of invasive ants in nesting territories, but doesn't really matter for the foraging behaviour aspect?",

We recorded incubation behaviour of the New Zealand robin (Petroica longipes), a species with female-only incubation, male incubation feeding and high nest predation rates. We examined how male incubation feeding, ambient temperature and food availability (invertebrate biomass) affected the different components of females' incubation behaviour and whether incubation behaviour explained variation in nest survival. Our results suggest that male incubation feeding rates of 2.8 per hour affect the female's incubation rhythm by reducing both on- and off-bout duration, resulting in no effect on female nest attentiveness, thus no support for the female-nutritional hypothesis. The incubation behaviours that we measured did not explain nest survival, despite high nest predation rates. Increased ambient temperature caused an increase in off-bout duration, whereas increased food availability increased on-bout duration.

In this study, we experimentally manipulated brood demand in free living great tits (Parus major) via brood size manipulations and compared the tactics adopted by parents in 2 successive years (2010 and 2011) with very different ecological conditions. In 2011, temperatures were warmer, there were fewer days with precipitation, and caterpillars (the preferred prey of great tits) made up a significantly larger proportion of the diet. In this good year, parents responded to experimental increases in brood demand by decreasing mean inter-visit intervals (IVIs) and reducing prey selectivity, which produced equal average long-term delivery of food to nestlings across the brood size treatments. In 2010, there was no evidence for effects of brood size manipulations on mean IVIs or prey selectivity. Consequently, nestlings from enlarged broods experienced significantly lower long-term average delivery rates compared with nestlings from reduced broods. In this bad year, parents also exhibited changes in the variance in inter-visit intervals (IVIs) as a function of treatment that were consistent with variance-sensitive foraging theory: variance in IVIs tended to be lowest for reduced broods and highest for enlarged broods. Importantly, this pattern differed significantly from that observed in the good year.

M.",Specialization reduces foraging effort and improves breeding performance in a generalist bird,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"While competition is generally presumed to promote intraspecific niche diversification, populations of many apparent generalist species still exhibit considerable individual variation in foraging specialization. This suggests that different cost-benefit trade-offs may underlie individual variation in foraging specialization. Indeed, while specialization may improve foraging efficiency by a better knowledge of the spatio-temporal availability of resources, individuals may also become more vulnerable to fluctuations in these resources. In this study, we used multiyear GPS tracking data of 19 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding along the Belgian coast to assess whether foraging effort and reproductive success varied among different levels of foraging specialization. First, we quantified spatial and habitat specialization during incubation and chick rearing for 31 individual breeding cycles during which birds raised young until the age of 21 days. Next, we tested whether spatial and habitat specialization were related to the daily distance covered (as a proxy for foraging effort), and to chick growth (as a proxy for reproductive success). We found that birds primarily varied in their extent of habitat specialization. Habitat specialization was associated with reduced daily distances covered and increased offspring growth rates, in particular the growth rate of the youngest chicks. Yet, positive effects of habitat specialization on chick growth decreased at high levels of spatial specialization. Our results thus demonstrate fitness benefits of foraging specialization during our 5-year study period, but also highlight the need for longer-term studies as environmental changes may cause benefits to vary throughout a lifetime.

Species, sex, or age classes may use different niches to reduce competition for food, which may be enforced by social dominance or may lead to ecological specialization. An alternate hypothesis is that individuals using resource patches that renew over time intentionally avoid recently depleted patches by avoiding each other. We tested these hypotheses by simultaneously radio-tracking northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) mates. Members of a pair rarely foraged in the same patch, spending over 90 % of the time > 50 m apart. Counter to the ecological specialization hypothesis, the types of ground cover used for foraging and the distance of foraging patches from cover and edge did not differ between males and females. Mates were more spatially segregated on the home range than random and males foraged closer to the nest than females, but we never saw agonistic behaviors counter to the dominance hypothesis. Both sexes avoided returning to the same foraging location repeatedly, perhaps because of prey depletion.

Besides calling when parents are present, nestlings of some species also perform less conspicuous repeat calls when parents are absent. The fact that these calls are produced when parents are not at the nest does not mean that parents cannot hear them when they approach the nest or forage in its vicinity. In this study, we experimentally investigated the relationship between parent-absent repeat calls (ARC) and frequency of parental visits, considering parent/offspring communication as a possible implication of these acoustic signals. A playback experiment was conducted to detect changes in parental investment in response to increases in parent-ARC, expecting a differential sexual response. Results showed that females clearly responded to repeat calls, increasing their visit rate significantly with respect to females that received the control treatment. Males, on the contrary, did not change their visit rate in response to the treatment. This result provides evidence for a role of parent/offspring communication in parent-absent repeat calling, an additional function to sibling negotiation processes.

In colonial-breeding species, inter-individual differences in foraging behaviour may evolve to reduce resource use overlap among conspecifics exploiting shared foraging areas. Furthermore, individual differences in foraging behaviour may covary with individual characteristics, such as sex or physiological conditions. Methods We investigated individual differences in foraging tactics of a colonial raptor, the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). We tracked foraging trips of breeding individuals using miniaturized biologgers. We classified behaviours from GPS data and identified tactics at the foraging trip level by cluster analysis. We then estimated energy expenditure associated to each tactic from tri-axial accelerometer data. Results We obtained 489 foraging trips by 36 individuals. Two clusters of trips were identified, one (SF) characterized by more static foraging behaviour and the other (DF) by more dynamic foraging behaviour, with a higher proportion of flying activity and a higher energy expenditure compared to SF. Lesser kestrels showed consistent inter-individual differences in foraging tactics across weather condition gradients, favouring DF trips as solar radiation and crosswind intensity increased. DF trips were more frequent during the nestling-rearing than during the egg incubation stage. Nestlings whose tracked parent was more prone to perform DF trips experienced higher daily mass increase, irrespective of nestling feeding rates. Conclusions Our study provided evidence that breeding lesser kestrels flexibly adopted different foraging tactics according to contingent weather landscapes, with birds showing consistent inter-individual differences in the tendency to adopt a given tactic.

In a study of pied flycatchers, we tested whether there are differences in the composition of food brought to young by the different parents and whether such sex differences are dependent on the hunger level of nestlings. We found that in normal feeding conditions, female parents provisioned nestlings with relatively more food collected from the tree canopy (caterpillars), whereas males brought more food caught in flight (adult lepidopterans). To imitate a temporary worsening of environmental conditions, we experimentally increased the hunger level of nestlings. Male parents responded to this manipulation by changing their foraging behavior such that the sex difference in provisioning behavior diminished. Possible explanations for the observed sex differences are discussed.

Parental investment in birds is usually assessed by quantifying feeding rates, but this provides an incomplete picture of parental effort because it fails to account for how parents collect food on the landscape. We studied northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), a woodpecker in which males provide the majority of parental care and used a repeated measures design and short-term (24 h) brood enlargements (N = 35) and reductions (N = 27) to assess effects of treatment on feeding rates to nestlings and parental foraging behaviour. Parents of enlarged broods did not significantly increase feeding rate, resulting in a decline in nestling mass. Parents of reduced broods decreased their feeding rates by 84%, but increased per capita feeding rates, resulting in nestling mass gain. The variation in feeding rates to enlarged broods was not influenced by feather corticosterone, body condition, feather re-growth rate or mass change between the incubation and nestling periods. Foraging pattern on the landscape remained the same during the enlarged treatment for both sexes. We conclude that flickers respond to proximate cues in brood demands, but do not increase feeding rates to enlarged broods, at least in the short term. A literature review suggested that this lack of response is atypical for short-lived species. We hypothesize that parents in species with large home ranges and long nestling periods face energetic limitations that constrain their ability to respond to enlarged broods.

Life history and foraging theory generally make predictions about mean behavior, but some circumstances might favor changes in the variance of parent and offspring behaviors. We analyzed data on free-living pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) experiencing a brood size manipulation. We used double hierarchical generalized linear models to investigate patterns in means and variances of provisioning, brood begging, and parental mass. As predicted by life history theory, parents with enlarged broods of intensely begging nestlings fed at higher rates and delivered more food per unit of time. They also delivered food at a more consistent rate. This contradicts the prediction from variance-sensitive foraging theory that parents facing higher brood demand should choose more variable foraging options. Indirect evidence suggests that reduced variance in trip time arose from shifts in parental time budgets. Exploratory analyses revealed patterns in residual variance of both nestling begging and parental mass changes, with enlarged broods begging less consistently and female body mass changes being more variable after longer foraging trips. We show that parent pied flycatchers simultaneously adjust means and variances in multiple aspects of their provisioning effort to changes in brood demand and that these responses might be linked with nestling begging and changes in parental body mass. Our study highlights both the importance of adopting sophisticated statistical approaches and the potential intersection of two bodies of theory that may affect strategic adjustments of individuals engaged in central place provisioning. Significance statement Central place foragers, such as many parent birds provisioning offspring, are subject to selective forces from both life history and foraging ecology. Most effects of selection are expected on mean behaviors, but adaptive life histories or foraging decisions can also influence variances. We analyzed both means and variances in parent pied flycatchers experiencing either increases or decreases in brood size. Parents with enhanced broods had shorter foraging trips and offspring that begged more, matching predictions from life history theory. They also exhibited less variation in trip time, contrary to predictions from variance sensitive foraging theory.

However, few studies have properly tested this assumption. In this study, we attempt to explore the short-term consequences of daily (within-pair) brood size manipulations (reduced, original, and enlarged) on feeding behavior (provisioning rates, prey size, and prey type) of Mediterranean blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. Total provisioning rates were lowest when broods were reduced in size and greatest when broods were enlarged. Mean prey size was also affected by the brood size changes: parents tended to bring larger prey when confronted with low brood demand reinforcing the view that a trade-off exists between minimizing foraging time and maximizing food quantity. Such differences in feeding frequencies and the load sizes delivered may be explained by changes in the parents' foraging tactic. Increase of brood size compelled parents to work harder and be less selective in prey choice; we found that stressed birds with a high level of feeding responsibility (hungry nestlings) opted to concentrate on more readily available food items (Tortricids). On the other hand, their immediate reaction when faced with a low level of feeding responsibility was to decrease this prey type in the diet, so that the percentage of other preys (Noctuids) in the diet increased. There was no intersexual difference in the way in which parents responded to the manipulation. In sum, our results revealed a flexibility in foraging strategies of blue tits to cope with changing scenarios, which supports the idea that provisioning behavior is largely governed by nestling demand.",2010,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01788.x,yes,audio video_ethology,exp,Cyanistes_caeruleus,passerine,bird,camera_trap,30,,0.125,,13,AB,yes,nest_attendance,"nest_provisioning, brood_size_manipulation",,
Serota_2019,"Serota, Mitchell W.; Williams, Tony D.",Adjustment of total activity as a response to handicapping European starlings during parental care,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Parental care is widely assumed to be costly, and life-history theory predicts that individuals that invest more in parental care should benefit in terms of number of offspring produced but that increased parental care might come at a cost in terms of decreased future fecundity and/or survival. However, the notion that parents that work 'harder', commonly measured by the rate at which parents visit the nestbox to provision their chicks, produce more, fitter chicks is surprisingly poorly supported. One potential reason for this apparent lack of relationship between measured workload during parental care and breeding productivity is that nest visit rate does not provide a good measure of foraging effort. Here, we used an automated radiotelemetry system to measure activity of individual female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, during breeding, combined with a handicapping experiment (combination of radiotransmitters and wing clipping) and measures of foraging metrics, current breeding productivity, future fecundity and return rate. Handicapping decreased current breeding success due to higher abandonment and nest failure, but among successful birds (fledging >= 1 chick) there was no effect of handicapping on brood size at fledging for the current breeding attempt. Handicapping decreased future fecundity, the probability of initiating a second brood, and return rate, but there was no evidence for additive costs of reproduction in wing-clipped females. Handicapping had no effect on provisioning rate but automated tracking data showed that, during chick rearing, wing-clipped females had 22% lower activity compared to females with radios only. Our data provide an explanation for the often contradictory effects of handicapping reported on reproductive effort and costs of reproduction: individuals can use behavioural flexibility - decreasing overall activity while maintaining provisioning rate - along with changes in mass and nestling diet to mitigate putative effects of increased workload imposed by handicapping.

We addressed this question in the ground tit, Pseudopodoces humilis, in which EPCs occur frequently and successful reproduction relies on biparental care. In solitarily breeding pairs, we calculated the feeding rate of social pairs at polyandrous and monogamous females' nests. Compared with that at monogamous nests, cuckolded males increased their feeding rate whereas polyandrous females reduced theirs. Polyandrous females had larger extrapair partners, although their extrapair young were neither heavier nor had higher heterozygosity than their within- pair young. Extrapair males never provided paternal care for the mixed brood and polyandrous females had no opportunity to forage on the territory of extrapair males. Therefore, the energetic benefit polyandrous females obtained was due to the increased parental care of their social mates. Even losing some share, cuckolded males still gained most of the paternity within the mixed brood. By increasing parental care for the current brood, they could ensure the survival of their own offspring. Thus, we suggest that females place their social male in a cruel bind by creating a larger brood containing some unrelated young: if the social male does not step up provisioning to meet the demands of the larger brood, overcrowding may reduce the survival of his offspring. Polyandrous females maintain the fitness incentive for their social males to provide parental care by limiting the paternity of extrapair males to a minority of the brood.

However, during periods of high demand, selectivity of prey may decline, leading to the delivery of smaller and/or less nutritious items. We compared foraging trade-offs between great tits (Parus major) which had a wider feeding niche than blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We also compared the foraging efficiency of cross-fostered young, which had learned the spatial foraging niche and prey size of the foreign species, to that of control conspecifics. Mean delivery rates did not differ between control and cross-fostered parents of either species but as delivery rates increased, prey size declined for both species and both treatment groups. However, across the range of increasing delivery rates, parents were able to increase the total biomass of prey delivered. Cross-fostering did not alter the proportion of different prey taxa in the diet, but cross-fostered birds shifted the size of the prey taken to that of their foster species. Consistent with their broader feeding niche, great tits, but not blue tits, incorporated more unpalatable items (flies) as delivery rates increased.

In doing so, their breeding ranges, but not necessarily their foraging habitats, have become intimately related to the nesting territories of their hosts. We studied home range sizes and distribution patterns in Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) on their breeding grounds in central Hungary, where cuckoos parasitize only Great Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) in channel-side reed-beds at a high frequency (>50%). The geographic coordinates of tagged cuckoos were monitored by high-precision, remotely downloadable non-Platform Terminal Transmitter global positioning system (GPS) loggers, attached to 9 females and 6 males. Our results revealed bimodal use of habitat patches: (1) the home ranges of male and female cuckoos were packed densely along the channels where the hosts breed, and their distribution maps had high overlaps between sexes; (2) similar to 71% of cuckoos also visited nearby woodland patches, presumably for foraging, where the host species was not present. The size of cuckoo home ranges varied to an unusually great extent: 0.3-185 km(2) as calculated by the minimum convex polygon method (85%), or 1-17 km(2) when calculated by the more suitable kernel density estimation (KDE) method (Utilization Distribution 85%) for patchy habitats. Male and female cuckoos had similar home range sizes as estimated by the KDE method, consisting of 1-4 areas within the 2 habitat types of channel reed-beds and woodlands. No preference was revealed for night roosting locations between the 2 habitats or sexes. Female cuckoos were more likely to use reed-beds in the afternoons, when females parasitize host nests.

In fact, detailed information about movement ecology and ranging behaviour of birds is important not only from the perspective of the basic ecology, but also from the conservation point of view. This is particularly important in European countries where agricultural intensification, land abandonment and the withdrawal of traditional management agro-forestry practices pose a threat to biodiversity. The Booted Eagle, likewise other forest raptors, is an adequate bioindicator of human-dominated agro-forestry Mediterranean landscapes in which low-intensity traditional agricultural practices still persist. Here, using a combination of an unbiased technology (i.e., GPS telemetry), a wide geographic extension of marked birds (all over Spain), and much larger sample size than in previous works, we provide the first quantitative assessment of the home range size and space use of the Booted Eagle by means of GPS satellite telemetry during the breeding season. Interestingly, our results revealed different levels of space use over the breeding season and showed that eagles perform long distance foraging movements (i.e., > 20 km) from the nest throughout the breeding season. This resulted in larger home ranges than reported thus far, and, more interestingly, in an extremely eccentric topology of territories. Hence, management measures for conservation of forest raptors based on setting restrictions around nesting sites using buffer areas of arbitrary radii clearly results in large areas of eagles' home ranges laying outside restriction areas. Therefore, conservation measures should take into account the full range of agro-forestry habitats encompassed within the home range. Finally, our results support the claim that a large-scale management approach beyond the establishment of a closed network of protected areas such as the Natura 2000 network is necessary for the conservation of Mediterranean raptors.",2016,10.1007/s10336-016-1357-z,yes,remote,obs,Aquila_pennata,raptor,bird,GPS,16,7779.2,,1277.1875,80,C,yes,nest_attendance,"nest_provisioning, habitat_selection, foraging_areas","80 days/year, but 4 seasons... should it be 320?",

Feeding habitats were classified using dominant substrate and structural characteristics, and prey availability was assessed by sampling 2,220 1-m(2) quadrates distributed throughout gull potential feeding areas. Both telemetry and monitoring of marked individuals indicated that gulls used 20 km of coastline but foraged mainly in three sectors located between 1.5 and 7 km north of the colony.

Results showed a differential distribution of crab species depending on habitat type, with a dominance of Cyrtograpsus altimanus in structured environments and Neohelice granulata in muddy substrates with vegetation. During incubation, gulls mostly used areas characterized by high densities of N. granulata, while during the early chick stage they mostly used sectors with high densities of C. altimanus.

We first tested the hypotheses that sexual segregation, density-dependent effects, and the intensity of management operations influenced home range size during the breeding season. The influence of these factors appeared to be limited in part due to random variability in foraging and dispersal decisions at individual and colony levels. We also designed a statistical framework to investigate the degree and determinants of migratory connectivity. Our analyses revealed a significant migratory connectivity in cormorants, although we also observed a nonnegligible amount of individual variability and flexibility. Our data were most consistent with the existence of a migratory divide across the Great Lakes, with western populations using mainly the Mississippi Flyway and eastern populations the Atlantic Flyway.

Changes in development and metabolism in turn are known to influence offspring's ability to adjust to environmental changes later in life. However, few studies have investigated the role of interspecific differences in incubation behaviour in relation to niche separation between competing sibling species. We studied the effects of habitat quality (in terms of caterpillar availability) on incubation behaviour of two ecologically similar and closely related species, collared and pied flycatchers (Ficedula albicollisandF. hypoleuca), in their hybrid zone on the island of oland, Sweden. Even though both species prefer caterpillar-rich deciduous forests as nesting sites, collared flycatchers, whose nestlings have higher energetic demands, are able to nest only in deciduous forests, whereas pied flycatchers have more flexible habitat requirements. Overall, higher food availability was associated with increased nest attendance, higher incubation temperature and a lower number of foraging trips across species. In addition, collared flycatchers had more frequent and shorter foraging trips across habitat types, allocated more heat to eggs and therefore maintained higher nest temperatures compared to pied flycatchers. We argue that the higher heat allocation or the need to maintain a higher nest temperature for embryo development may constrain collared flycatchers to focus on relatively more profitable prey. Our results highlight the importance of considering incubation behaviour in the context of understanding species differences in niche use. Significance statement Niche separation plays an important role in mitigating effects of competition between closely related species. Whether species differences in incubation behaviour relate to differences in niche use remains unknown. We compared incubation behaviour of two sympatric flycatcher species that differ in sensitivity to food availability. The competitively more dominant and larger species, the collared flycatcher, whose nestlings are more sensitive to food shortages, made more frequent foraging trips but allocated more heat to eggs, leading to higher nest temperature despite lower nest attendance, compared to pied flycatchers. These interspecific differences may be a result of differences in embryo sensitivity or female physiology and contribute to the niche separation between the species, which in turn can facilitate coexistence.",2020,10.1007/s00265-020-02883-4,yes,ethology,obs,"Ficedula_hypoleuca, Ficedula_albicollis",passerine,bird,temperature_logger,44,n/a,4,,18,B,yes,nest_attendance,"nest_provisioning, incubation",foraging = time away from nest = cold periods on temp logger in nest box,

The Chinese Grouse (Tetrastes sewerzowi) lives in high mountain conifer forests and faces energy stress, cold environment, and predation pressure. Females might adjust incubation rhythm to adapt to these constraints.MethodsTwo methods were used to investigate egg laying and incubation pattern of the Chinese Grouse; 25 nests were monitored by data loggers and 12 nests by infrared video cameras. ResultsFemale Chinese Grouses usually laid an egg every 2days. The incubation period was 28-31days. Overall incubation constancy for Chinese Grouse was 93%. The females took 5.0 recesses per day and 34% of all 1696 recesses were taken in the crepuscular period. The average recess duration was 20.3min. Females took more and shorter recesses in the latter part of incubation. The females who allocated more time to foraging had a higher reproductive success. ConclusionsProbably due to its high egg/body mass ratio, the Chinese Grouse has a long laying interval of 49h. We suggest that, due to energy stress, females have relatively more recesses and they increase the number of recesses as incubation progresses.

However, in raptors, the larger female usually broods and feeds the nestlings, while the smaller male provides food for the family, assisted by the female in the latter part of the nestling period, if at all. Prey items are relatively large and often impossible for nestlings to handle without extended maternal assistance. We video-recorded prey delivery and handling in nests of a raptor with a wide diet, the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus, and simultaneously observed prey transfer from male to female outside the nest. The male selectively allocated larger items, in particular birds and larger mammals, to the female for further processing and feeding of nestlings, and smaller items, in particular lizards and smaller mammals, directly to the nestlings for unassisted feeding. Hence, from the video, the female appeared to have captured larger prey than the male, while in reality no difference existed. The female's size-biased interception of the male's prey provisioning line would maximize the male's foraging time, and maximize the female's control of the allocation of food between her own need and that of the offspring. The male would maximize his control of food allocation by capturing smaller prey. This conflict would select for larger dominant females and smaller energy-efficient males, and induce stronger selection the longer the female depends on the male for self-feeding, as a proportion of the offspring dependence period.",2013,10.1007/s00442-012-2491-9,yes,audio video_ethology,obs,Falco_tinnunculus,raptor,bird,"camera_trap, direct_obs",19,1000,0.859649123,,120,B,no,nest_attendance,"nest_provisioning, niche_differentiation",,

When this occurs, reduced provisioning by males obliges females to forage instead of providing warmth for offspring, favoring the temporal mapping of male activities. We assessed this in a wild house wren population while experimentally feeding nestlings to control offspring satiety. While brooding, females look out from the nest to inspect their surroundings, and we hypothesized that this helps to determine if their mate is nearby and likely to deliver food to the brood (males pass food to brooding females, which pass the food to nestlings). Females looked out from the nest less often when their partner was singing nearby and when his singing and provisioning were temporally linked, signaling his impending food delivery. Females also left to forage less often when their mate was nearby and likely to deliver food. Nestling begging did not affect these behaviors. Females looking out from the nest more often also provisioned at a higher rate and were more likely to divorce and find a new mate prior to nesting again within seasons, as expected if females switch mates when a male fails to meet expectations.

Within-individual variance could exist because of responses to variable environments (plasticity) or because exhibiting variance per se has fitness consequences. To evolve, the latter requires between-individual variance in within-individual variance. Here, we investigate the parental behavior of female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and assess if the distribution of within-individual variance also differs between individuals or changes with respect to environmental conditions. We used a statistical approach that models both the mean and variance iteratively. We found that the amount of food delivered per second on each visit was influenced by female identity, nestling age, and the location (on vs. off territory) where the female foraged. Moreover, we also found that unexplained within-individual variance (residual variance), after controlling for mean effects, independently declined with nestling age and was smaller when females foraged off their mate's territory. In addition, females differed in residual variance more than expected by chance. These results confirm that phenotypic variance has a hierarchical structure and they support preconditions for the evolution of mean phenotypic values as well as the variance in phenotype.

Parents should thus adjust provisioning activity according to current predation threat levels. Moreover, life-history theory predicts that response to predation threat should be correlated with investment in current reproduction. We experimentally manipulated perceived predation threat in free-living great tits (Parus major) by presenting parents with a nest predator model while monitoring different aspects of provisioning behavior and nestling begging. Experiments were conducted in 2 years differing greatly in ecological conditions, including food availability. We further quantified male territorial aggressiveness and male and female exploratory tendency. Parents adjusted provisioning according to current levels of threat in an apparently adaptive way. They delayed nest visits during periods of elevated perceived predation threat and subsequently compensated for lost feeding opportunities by increasing provisioning once the immediate threat had diminished. Nestling begging increased after elevated levels of predation threat, but returned to baseline levels by the end of the experiment, suggesting that parents had fully compensated for lost feeding opportunities. There was no evidence for a link between male exploration behavior or aggressiveness and provisioning behavior. In contrast, fast-exploring females provisioned at higher rates, but only in the year with poor environmental conditions, which might indicate a greater willingness to invest in current reproduction in general.

Moore_2012,"Moore, S. Drew; Rohwer, Vanya G.",The functions of adult female begging during incubation in sub-Arctic breeding yellow warblers,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Begging behaviour in birds is frequently studied in nestlings, but the function of adult female begging behaviour remains unknown. We examined begging behaviours of adult female yellow warblers, Setophaga petechia, during incubation at the northern limit of their breeding range. Female yellow warblers beg only when their mate arrives at the nest, and vocalization duration, intensity of wing fluttering and position of the female's body on the nest varies between begging events. We measured changes in these characteristics for 696 begging events from nine incubating females and examined how begging intensity changed with temperature and time since a female's last feeding. Begging intensity increased as the duration between feedings increased especially during colder temperatures. Next, we investigated how male feeding rates changed in response to variation in female begging intensity. Males fed females more quickly in response to intense begging during warm temperatures but not during cold temperatures. Finally, we investigated whether male feeding rates influenced the frequency or duration of the female's bouts away from the nest (i.e. 'off-bouts') during which the female had the opportunity to forage. Females that were fed more frequently reduced the average duration, but not the frequency, of their off-bouts. These results suggest that variation in the intensity of female begging behaviour signals energetic need, and that begging during incubation may be an important adaptation allowing female yellow warblers to maximize incubation time when breeding in sub-Arctic environments.

In turn, factors influencing maternal cares can have important effects at individual and population levels, with consequences at both short and long temporal scales. We assessed monthly variation of behavioural indices of suckling and nursing, as well as occurrence of allosuckling, in a mountain-dwelling ungulate, the Apennine chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, on summer-early autumn 2013-2014. Not surprisingly, duration of suckling events and frequency of suckling solicitations by kids, decreased throughout months, whereas the proportion of grazing kids increased from July to October, indicating a growing reliance on pasture. Conversely, the probability of suckling success kept stable from July to October, suggesting a constant willingness of females to allow kids to suckle. Of all suckling events, 63% involved more than one kid, indicating allosuckling. On average, multiple suckles were shorter than those involving one kid and occurred in all months with the same proportion.Our results suggest the occurrence of high levels of maternal cares in a gregarious herbivore, with frequent allosuckling and apparent willingness of females to nurse offspring throughout summer-autumn.

Santema_2013b,"Santema, Peter; Clutton-Brock, Tim",Meerkat helpers increase sentinel behaviour and bipedal vigilance in the presence of pups,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Helpers in cooperatively breeding species may assist in a number of cooperative activities, such as nest building, incubating, babysitting and feeding of offspring. In addition, individuals may engage in sentinel behaviour and other forms of vigilance, which benefits other group members not only by reducing the risk of predation, but also by allowing them to reduce their own vigilance. It remains unclear, however, whether these vigilance behaviours are selfish, and the benefits to other group members simply an unselected by-product, or whether they are forms of cooperation, and the benefits to group members a selective force favouring the behaviour. In meerkats, Suricata suricatta, both female and male helpers were more likely to perform sentinel behaviour after dependent pups had started joining the group on foraging trips. In addition, female helpers performed more bipedal vigilance and found less food when pups were in the group. These results suggest that sentinel behaviour and bipedal vigilance represent forms of cooperation in meerkats. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Reductions in wetland area during the last 15years have led to proposals to build a Poyang Dam to retain high winter water levels within the lake. Changing the natural hydrological system will affect waterbirds dependent on water level changes for food availability and accessibility. We tracked two goose species with different feeding behaviors (greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons [grazing species] and swan geese Anser cygnoides [tuber-feeding species]) during two winters with contrasting water levels (continuous recession in 2015; sustained high water in 2016, similar to those predicted post-Poyang Dam), investigating the effects of water level change on their habitat selection based on vegetation and elevation. In 2015, white-fronted geese extensively exploited sequentially created mudflats, feeding on short nutritious graminoid swards, while swan geese excavated substrates along the water edge for tubers. This critical dynamic ecotone successively exposes subaquatic food and supports early-stage graminoid growth during water level recession. During sustained high water levels in 2016, both species selected mudflats, but also to a greater degree of habitats with longer established seasonal graminoid swards because access to tubers and new graminoid growth was restricted under high-water conditions. Longer established graminoid swards offer less energetically profitable forage for both species. Substantial reduction in suitable habitat and confinement to less profitable forage by higher water levels is likely to reduce the ability of geese to accumulate sufficient fat stores for migration, with potential carryover effects on subsequent survival and reproduction.

Here, we investigated whether parasites affect behavioural time allocation in a free-ranging ungulate that must apportion time to multiple competing activities crucial for maintenance, survival and reproduction. We examined how experimental removal of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes influenced the relative amounts of time that female Grant's gazelle, Nanger granti, allocated to core behaviours including foraging, vigilance, moving and resting. The anthelmintic treatment reduced female parasite load for similar to 120 days, and during this period, females relieved of their parasitic nematodes adjusted their daily time budgets. At the group level, parasite removal resulted in an increase in foraging time and a decrease in vigilance. This effect was also apparent at the individual level, where treated females allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. In addition to treatment, group size was a significant predictor of the relative time spent foraging versus vigilant, where females in larger groups allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. Our results suggest that parasites may induce changes in host behaviour that are of similar magnitude to some of the most commonly studied social drivers of behavioural time allocation.

In capital breeders, heterogeneity in reproductive success is often related to body mass or condition, underlining the importance of stored reserves for reproduction. Heterogeneity in the rate of resource acquisition could also affect reproduction. Resource acquisition depends on food intake, but the effects of individual foraging rate on mass gain and reproductive success in wild herbivorous mammals are unknown. We measured how individual bite rate affected mass change and reproductive success of 55 female eastern gray kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) over 2 years. Females with faster bite rate had greater subsequent mass gain, leading to greater offspring survival. In one of 2 years, bite rate directly increased juvenile survival to 8 months. Bite rate appeared to have a direct effect on survival to weaning for young born to females with above-average mass gain, particularly for females in better body condition. Independent of bite rate, individual mass change explained most of the variation in offspring survival. We found a weak positive effect of body condition on reproductive success, suggesting that condition affected reproductive success through its effect on mass change and bite rate. Kangaroos appeared to combine income and capital breeding strategies to deal with internal and external constraints on resource allocation.

Clarke_2010,"Clarke, J. A.",White-tailed ptarmigan food calls enhance chick diet choice: learning nutritional wisdom?,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Social learning is predicted to be adaptive when independent learning is time-consuming, dangerous or difficult. For a naive individual confronted with an array of novel foods, determining the nutritional value of unfamiliar foods can be challenging, and an increased reliance on social learning would be favoured by selection. I investigated whether the multimodal display of food calling and tid-bitting by white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens adaptively biases chicks' intake of foods of different nutrient content via social learning. Ptarmigan were observed in California's Sierra Nevada alpine for two summer seasons. In 116 foraging bouts, I observed 100 instances of hen food calling (to six plant species) and 100 responses by chicks. The relative proportion of each plant species in the chicks' diet was significantly and positively related to the proportion of food calls associated with that plant species, but not with its relative availability. Plant species that elicited food calls by hens had significantly more protein than did random mixtures of plants or than did foods eaten by the hens that did not elicit food calls. Chicks of hens that often uttered calls consumed diets significantly higher in protein than did chicks of hens that rarely called. Preferences were maintained as chicks became older and foraged further from their mothers, and food calling ceased, indicating social learning. Hens' food calling biased chicks' diet choices, supporting the prediction that socially acquired information plays a prominent role when an animal is seeking a nutrient that is difficult to identify (protein). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that ptarmigan hens engage in teaching, but further studies are required before it can be stated conclusively that they teach their chicks nutritional wisdom.

When the needs of dependent offspring differ from those of the parent, ideal habitat selection patterns could vary with the presence or absence of offspring. We test whether habitat selection depends on reproductive state due to top-down or bottom-up influences on the fitness of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a threatened, wide-ranging herbivore. We combined established methods of fitting resource and step selection functions derived from locations of collared animals in Ontario with newer techniques, including identifying calf status from video collar footage and seasonal habitat selection analysis through latent selection difference functions. We found that females with calves avoided predation risk and proximity to roads more strongly than females without calves within their seasonal ranges. At the local scale, females with calves avoided predation more strongly than females without calves. Females with calves increased predation avoidance but not selection for food availability upon calving, whereas females without calves increased selection for food availability across the same season. These behavioral responses suggest that habitat selection by woodland caribou is influenced by reproductive state, such that females with calves at heel use habitat selection to offset the increased vulnerability of their offspring to predation risk.",2018,10.1002/ece3.4124,yes,audio video_remote,obs,Rangifer_tarandus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, RSF, SSF, video_logger",9,142172,1.85,773,111,ABC,yes,habitat_selection,"parental_care, movement, habitat_selection","camera collars were mostly used to monitor calf survival, not what's being eaten",

In mammals, the most energetically expensive form of infant care is lactation, followed by infant carrying in species where young are transported over long distances. In titi monkeys, infants are carried primarily by males, which allows us to tease apart the effects of lactation and infant carrying. We analysed activity budgets and diet composition in adult males and females in seven free-ranging groups of red titi monkeys, Plecturocebus cupreus, in the Peruvian Amazon over 14 months. Females fed more, consumed more arthropods and rested less after infant birth than before, and males fed less, consumed fewer arthropods and rested more. Lactating females increased feeding time at the expense of mainly resting and, to a lesser degree, social time. Despite the general decrease in social time, females conserved grooming time within pairs. Our results suggest that females and males use opposing strategies to cope with the costs of parental care and indicate the importance of pair bond maintenance for females.

Rapaport_2011,"Rapaport, Lisa G.",Progressive parenting behavior in wild golden lion tamarins,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Young primates in the family Callitrichidae (the marmosets and tamarins) receive extensive and relatively prolonged care from adults. Of particular note, callitrichid young are routinely provisioned until well after weaning by parents and helpers, which is in stark contrast to typical juvenile primates, who must acquire most of their food independently once they are weaned. Adults of some callitrichid species produce a specialized vocalization that encourages immature group members to take proffered food from the caller. Here, I report that wild adult golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) not only used this food-offering call to encourage young, mobile offspring to approach and take captured prey from them, but as the young began to spend significant time foraging for themselves and to acquire prey by independent means, the frequency of these vocalizations in the context of food transfer declined. Adults then began to use food-offering calls in a novel context: to direct juveniles to foraging sites that contained hidden prey that the adults had found but not captured. During the period of these most frequent adult-directed prey captures, the independent prey-capture success rates of juveniles improved. Thus, adults modified their provisioning behavior in a progressive developmentally sensitive manner that may have facilitated learning how to find food. I hypothesize that as a result of these demonstrations by adults, juveniles either may be encouraged to continue foraging despite low return rates or to learn the properties of productive prey-foraging substrates in a complex environment.",2011,10.1093/beheco/arr055,yes,ethology,obs,Leontopithecus_rosalia,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, ethogram",47,31.26,2.658958333,,110.25,AB,yes,ethogram,"parental_care, social, developmental","2000 to 2003, but each group was studied ~16weeks",
Kazahari_2014,"Kazahari, Nobuko","Maintaining social cohesion is a more important determinant of patch residence time than maximizing food intake rate in a group-living primate, Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata)",PRIMATES,"Animals have been assumed to employ an optimal foraging strategy (e.g., rate-maximizing strategy). In patchy food environments, intake rate within patches is positively correlated with patch quality, and declines as patches are depleted through consumption. This causes patch-leaving and determines patch residence time. In group-foraging situations, patch residence times are also affected by patch sharing. Optimal patch models for groups predict that patch residence times decrease as the number of co-feeding animals increases because of accelerated patch depletion. However, group members often depart patches without patch depletion, and their patch residence time deviates from patch models. It has been pointed out that patch residence time is also influenced by maintaining social proximity with others among group-living animals. In this study, the effects of maintaining social cohesion and that of rate-maximizing strategy on patch residence time were examined in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). I hypothesized that foragers give up patches to remain in the proximity of their troop members. On the other hand, foragers may stay for a relatively long period when they do not have to abandon patches to follow the troop. In this study, intake rate and foraging effort (i.e., movement) did not change during patch residency. Macaques maintained their intake rate with only a little foraging effort. Therefore, the patches were assumed to be undepleted during patch residency. Further, patch residence time was affected by patch-leaving to maintain social proximity, but not by the intake rate. Macaques tended to stay in patches for short periods when they needed to give up patches for social proximity, and remained for long periods when they did not need to leave to keep social proximity.

Social monitoring is visual scanning by group members that assists them in following their own group. Individuals in smaller feeding groups may frequently use social monitoring while foraging, because they have an increased risk of losing their group. Therefore, social monitoring could be a cost for group-foraging animals. We made four predictions: (1) individuals in smaller feeding groups tend to abandon food patches to follow group members; (2) social monitoring frequency is higher in smaller feeding groups; (3) feeding rate decreases with increased social monitoring frequency; and (4) feeding rate initially increases with feeding group size because decreased social monitoring outweighs increased feeding competition, but after the feeding group reaches a certain size, feeding rate declines with increasing feeding group size due to the high costs of feeding competition. These predictions were supported by our results. Thus, the relationship between feeding group size and feeding rate can show three patterns (positive, neutral and negative) in response to the balance between the costs of social monitoring and feeding competition.",2010,10.1163/000579510X521573,yes,ethology,obs,Macaca_fuscata,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",4,10,0.739583333,,14,AB,yes,ethogram,"patch_movement, social",the same data as another M_fuscata paper in 2014,

However, crab density was lower when terns left the patches than when they arrived.

To understand patterns of animal movements, it is especially important to explore how they are affected by differences in landscape and habitat configuration. This paper presents an analysis of the movement patterns of a species of conservation concern in Northwest Amazon, the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), in relation to landscape elements identified as resource concentration areas (palm stands and natural salt licks). We identify the structure of the movement behavior of a sub-adult male lowland tapir using Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) and a set of metrics capturing velocity and variance. We also estimate this tapir's Utilization Distribution (UD) using the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (dBBMM) in order to better understand its trajectories and space-use patterns. Our results provide insights about this animal's movement, making it possible to differentiate between foraging behaviors, characterized by long trips and selective resource use, and explorative behaviors, characterized by short displacements and a notable decrease in the usage of resource areas and its trajectories. The high influence of landscape elements on movement characteristics suggest that tapirs may perceive the Amazonian forest as heterogeneous rather than homogeneous mosaics. Therefore, the study of movement characteristics proves to be useful for the development of future studies and conservation plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Edwards_2015,"Edwards, Mark A.; Derocher, Andrew E.",Mating-related behaviour of grizzly bears inhabiting marginal habitat at the periphery of their North American range,BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,"In comparison to core populations, peripheral populations have low density and recruitment, and are subject to different selective pressures, such as environmental conditions, food type and availability, predation, disease, etc., which may result in behavioural modifications to mating. We test the roam-to-mate hypothesis for a peripheral population of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) at the northern extent of their North American range, in Canada's Arctic. If bears are roaming-to-mate, we predicted greater range size and daily displacement, and more linear movements for receptive animals during the mating period compared to post-mating. In contrast to our predictions, we found that in general range size and displacement increased from mating to post-mating regardless of reproductive status. When considered across both periods, females with cubs-of-the-year had smaller range use metrics than other reproductive groups, which we attribute to a counter-strategy against sexually selected infanticide and the reduced mobility of cubs. Linearity of movements remained near zero during both periods across all groups, suggesting tortuous movements more characteristic of foraging than of mate-searching. We suggest that for this population, finding quality habitat takes precedence over mate-searching in this marginal Arctic landscape. Alternatively, a more monogamous mating system and sequestering behaviour may have obscured movement differences between the two periods. The behavioural differences in mating that we observed from what is typical of core populations may reflect local adaptation to marginal conditions and could benefit the species in the face of ongoing environmental change.

Martinez_2018,"Martinez, Ari E.; Pollock, Henry S.; Kelley, J. Patrick; Tarwater, Corey E.",Social information cascades influence the formation of mixed-species foraging aggregations of ant-following birds in the Neotropics,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Animals frequently make decisions based on social information obtained from other animals, which can influence interspecific interactions and affect individual fitness. For example, animals eavesdrop on other animals to find profitable food resources, yet the types of cues they use and how these cues influence decisions to approach a resource remain poorly understood. In tropical systems, arthropods inadvertently flushed by army ant, Eciton burchellii, swarms are an important food resource for many bird species, which form mixed-species foraging aggregations at swarms. Competition at swarms is intense and birds vocalize to defend foraging areas, inadvertently producing acoustic social information about the swarm's location. Eavesdropping birds may use these acoustic cues, which provide information about the bird aggregation (i.e. species participating in the aggregation, the size of the aggregation and/or diversity of the aggregation) to assess potential benefits (food resources) and costs (competition for food) of joining an aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we used an acoustic playback experiment to simulate aggregations of birds foraging at ant swarms and we measured community-wide and guild-specific responses of forest birds to playbacks. We included three types of acoustic social information in playbacks that potentially interact to affect an eavesdropping bird's probability of attraction to a swarm: (1) aggregation size, (2) aggregation species richness and (3) degree of specialization on ant swarms for food of birds vocalizing in the aggregation (hereafter 'dependency'). Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, we found that playbacks of obligate ant-following species elicited greater community-wide responses (i.e. attracted more individuals and species) to simulated aggregations compared to playbacks of other, less dependent guilds. We also found that interactions between dependency, species richness and aggregation size influenced the overall community response to playbacks and that species from one guild generally responded to the guild above them (i.e. from less to more specialized). Our results suggest that species evaluate multiple types of acoustic cues representing the costs and benefits of foraging in a mixed-species aggregation at a swarm. We hypothesize that species change from information receivers to information producers upon joining a swarm, ultimately producing an information cascade that further affects the dynamics of feeding aggregations at swarms.

Growing evidence focused on human-altered acoustic environments suggests that anthropogenic noise can strongly interfere with the reception of biologically relevant sounds, causing a variety of behavioural changes in response to the evolutionarily novel acoustic conditions created by humans. However, little is known about how background natural sounds, such as river noise and biotic choruses, alter behaviour. Using field-placed playback of predominantly low-frequency whitewater river rapids, higher-frequency cicada choruses (similar to 7.0-15.0 kHz) or a silent control, we sought to determine whether background natural sounds influence vigilance and foraging behaviour in the California ground squirrel. We found that California ground squirrels exposed to low-frequency river sounds increased vigilance and decreased foraging and movement relative to ambient acoustic conditions during control trials and, to a lesser extent, acoustic conditions imposed by the cicada chorus playback. Additionally, vigilance increased with sound level regardless of whether the playback stimulus was the low-frequency river noise or the high-frequency cicada chorus. However, background sound level interacted with group size, such that increased sound levels were associated with a strong increase in vigilance in small groups but not in larger groups. To our knowledge these results are the first to demonstrate that the spectral content and amplitude of natural sounds can influence vigilance and movement behaviours. Yet our results match those from recent studies reporting increased vigilance in response to low-frequency anthropogenic noise, suggesting that many observed responses to anthropogenic sounds may be those that animals have used to cope with variable sound levels from natural sources throughout their evolutionary history.

However, chiropterophily in the Old World and the pollination roles of large bats, such as flying foxes (Pteropus spp., Acerodon spp., Desmalopex spp.), are still poorly understood and require further elucidation. Efforts to protect these bats have been hampered by a lack of basic quantitative information on their role as ecosystem service providers. Here, we investigate the role of the locally endangered island flying fox Pteropus hypomelanus in the pollination ecology of durian (Durio zibethinus), an economically important crop in Southeast Asia. On Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia, we deployed 19 stations of paired infrared camera and video traps across varying heights at four individual flowering trees in a durian orchard. We detected at least nine species of animal visitors, but only bats had mutualistic interactions with durian flowers. There was a clear vertical stratification in the feeding niches of flying foxes and nectar bats, with flying foxes feeding at greater heights in the trees. Flying foxes had a positive effect on mature fruit set and therefore serve as important pollinators for durian trees. As such, semi-wild durian trees-particularly tall ones-may be dependent on flying foxes for enhancing reproductive success. Our study is the first to quantify the role of flying foxes in durian pollination, demonstrating that these giant fruit bats may have far more important ecological, evolutionary, and economic roles than previously thought.

We assessed three components of visual information gathering in a sit-and-wait avian predator, the black phoebe (Sayornis nigricans): configuration of the visual field, degree of eye movement, and scanning behavior through head-movement rates. We found that black phoebes have larger lateral visual fields than similarly sized ground-foraging passerines, as well as relatively narrower binocular and blind areas. Black phoebes moved their eyes, but eye movement amplitude was relatively smaller than in other passerines. Black phoebes may compensate for eye movement constraints with head movements. The rate of head movements increased before attacking prey in comparison to non-foraging contexts and before movements between perches. These findings suggest that black phoebes use their lateral visual fields, likely subtended by areas of high acuity in the retina, to track prey items in a three-dimensional space through active head movements. These head movements may increase depth perception, motion detection and tracking.

The response of a predator to moon phases may represent a complex trade-off between overcoming the antipredator strategies of its prey and balancing other needs/constraints (e. g. individual status and condition). We explored the year-round effects of the lunar cycle on radiotagged breeders and dispersers of an avian predator, the eagle owl, Bubo bubo, from the perspective of movement patterns, foraging effort and display intensity. In general, the movements of breeders suggested an increase in activity around the time of the full moon. This may be related to an increase in both the time needed to detect prey (on brighter nights prey are more concealed and wary) and the time the predator devotes to visual displays (the full moon increases the conspicuousness of signalling). However, hunting activity also peaked during dark nights, when prey might be harder to see. In contrast, the behaviour of dispersing owls was not affected by lunar cycles. Natal dispersal involves potentially dangerous crossings of unknown landscapes (which probably requires similar effort throughout the year), and because of the absence of reproductive constraints should not require greater activity when food profitability is low. The status of individuals may thus play a crucial role in cost-benefit considerations and behavioural decisions, by directly affecting the time and effort individuals need to allocate to various activities related to their most immediate needs (e. g. breeding successfully versus overcoming dispersal costs).

Studies that assess trade-offs between migratory strategies typically compare the amount of predation risk and forage resources migrants and residents are exposed to only while on separate ranges and assume both groups intermix completely while on sympatric ranges. Here we provide one of the first tests of this assumption by comparing the amount of overlap between home ranges of GPS-collared migrant and resident elk and fine-scale exposure to wolf predation risk and forage biomass at telemetry locations on a sympatric winter range in west-central Alberta, Canada. Overlap between migrant and resident home ranges increased throughout the winter, and both groups were generally intermixed and exposed to equal forage biomass. During the day, both migrants and residents avoided predation risk by remaining in areas far from timber with high human activity, which wolves avoided. However, at night wolves moved onto the grasslands close to humans and away from timber. Resident elk were consistently closer to areas of human activity and further from timber than migrants, possibly because of a habituation to humans. As a result, resident elk were exposed to higher night-time predation risk than migrants.

Sorato_2012,"Sorato, Enrico; Gullett, Philippa R.; Griffith, Simon C.; Russell, Andrew F.",Effects of predation risk on foraging behaviour and group size: adaptations in a social cooperative species,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"There is a divergence between models examining the evolution of group living in species in which groups are largely based on families and those based on fluid aggregations of nonrelatives. In the former, the onus has been on ecological and demographic factors that select for offspring philopatry; in the latter, the importance of factors such as foraging success and predation risk are more typically emphasized. We examined the association between predation risk and both group size and foraging behaviour in the chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, a family-living cooperatively breeding bird that does not appear to face classic ecological or demographic constraints on dispersal and breeding. Groups were more likely to encounter, and be attacked by, avian predators when dependent young were present. Large groups were also more likely to encounter a predator, but less likely to be attacked by it, consistent with a benefit of group living through early predator detection or confusion effects. In addition, the average risk of predation for a given individual was reduced in large groups compared to small ones, owing to the dilution effect. That predation might partly select for group living in this species is boosted by findings showing reductions in ground foraging and increases in sentinel behaviour when predation risk was higher. We conclude that predation might represent an important force selecting for sociality in chestnut-crowned babblers, and highlight the need for future studies to consider more explicitly inherent benefits to group living in the evolution of vertebrate cooperative breeding systems. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Such nonconsumptive effects may be as strong or stronger than consumptive predator effects. However, evidence for this in large terrestrial vertebrate systems is equivocal and few studies quantify the actual fitness costs of nonconsumptive effects. Here, we investigated whether nonconsumptive effects elicited by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), a large terrestrial predator, reduced survival in an ungulate prey, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). To reveal the behavioral processes underlying nonconsumptive effects, we distinguished between proactive risk avoidance of areas with high lynx encounter probability, and reactive risk avoidance in response to actual lynx encounters and analyzed these responses using step selection functions. We also quantified the consequences of these behaviors for deer survival. Deer reacted differently at day and at night, but avoided high-risk areas proactively during the day and at night in the summer. During a predator encounter, deer increased avoidance of high-risk areas at night but not during the day. Thus, roe deer exhibited a behavioral response race that involved temporally and spatially varying tradeoffs with environmental constraints. We found evidence that nonconsumptive effects of lynx predation risk reduced deer survival and that survival was more sensitive to variation in nonconsumptive effects of lynx than to variation in human proximity.

We manipulated both factors by means of predator fecal scents and ungulate exclosures. We hypothesized that high-risk perception and ungulate presence would promote acorn dispersal. In the former case, it would stimulate acorn mobilization to safe microhabitats rather than in situ consumption. In the latter, increased competition for acorns would promote their storage for later consumption. We also expected that mice would adapt their foraging behavior to previous experience modulating the strength of these effects. In the presence of ungulates, mice focused their foraging activities on food acquisition at the expenses of vigilant behaviors. However, a more efficient foraging did not entail enhanced dispersal services. Lack of anti-predatory cover in tree surroundings may have deterred mice from transporting seeds outside canopies. Increased risk interacted with previous experience. In control trees (no predator odor), mice confidence increased throughout the night resulting in decreased vigilance and enhanced acorn mobilization rates. In contrast, in risky conditions (trees with predator odor) mice maintained a base-line vigilant behavior. Contrary to our expectations, increased risk did not result in higher acorn mobilization, but the opposite. Again, the scarcity of safe microhabitats for mobilization may have been the underlying cause of this behavior. Our results show that successful acorn dispersal depends, at least partly, on plant-animal relationships that are beyond the oak-rodent mutualism. Thus, any conservation policy aimed at restoring natural regeneration of oaks should take into account the interaction network in which oak-rodent encounters are embedded. In addition, they suggest that mice incorporate direct and indirect cues of risks (habitat structure) through recent experience. A better understanding of this process will improve our ability to incorporate such temporal and spatial variability in models of acorn dispersal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Roe deer were extremely vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social organization of the deer.

Where large carnivores have declined, mesocarnivores may quantitatively increase foraging, commensurate with reductions in fear. The extirpation of large carnivores may further exacerbate mesocarnivore impacts by causing qualitative changes in mesocarnivore behavior. Error management theory suggests that, where predators are present, prey should be biased towards over-responsiveness to predator cues, abandoning foraging in response to both predator cues and benign stimuli mistaken for predator cues (false-positives). Where predators are absent, prey may avoid these foraging costs by becoming unresponsive (naive) to both predator cues and false-positives. If naivete occurs in mesocarnivores where large carnivores have been extirpated, it could substantively exacerbate their impacts, as fearless mesocarnivores may engage in virtually unrestricted foraging. We tested the naivete of raccoons (Procyon lotor) to extirpated large carnivores in the context of a larger experiment demonstrating that fear of large carnivores can mediate mesocarnivore impacts. Raccoon responsiveness to playbacks of their extirpated large carnivore predators (cougars, Puma concolor; bears, Ursus americanus) was significantly less than to the only extant large carnivore predator (dogs), and was no greater than to non-predators (seals; Phoca vitulina, Eumetopias jubatus). Raccoons failed to recognize their now extirpated predators as threatening, spending as much time foraging as when hearing non-predators, which we estimate has substantive impacts, based on results from the larger experiment.

In addition, we tested if the effects of predation risk cascade down to other trophic levels by measuring rates of seed dispersal of the tree Muntingia calabura. Using video recording, we found that bats significantly decreased the foraging frequency on trees when a visual cue of T. alba was present. However, no stimuli of potential predatory birds, including vocalization of T. alba, affected bat foraging frequency. There was a change in bat behavior during 7 min, but then their frequency of activity gradually increased. Consequently, the presence of T. alba decreased by up to ten times the rate of seed removal. These results indicate that risk sensitivity of frugivorous phyllostomid bats depends on predator identity and presence. Among the predators used in this study, only T. alba is an effective bat predator in the Neotropics.

Models for FID have been used with some success to predict distance fled (DF). We studied effects of foraging opportunity cost of fleeing and examined differences between age-sex groups in the omnivorous Balearic Lizard, Podarcis lilfordi. Balearic lizards forage on the ground for invertebrate prey and climb the thistle Carlina corymbosa to forage on its inflorescences. We studied escape behaviour in three experimental groups, with human beings as simulated predators: lizard foraging above ground on C.corymbosa, foraging on the ground away from thistles and on the ground with cut inflorescences. Flight initiation distance was shorter for lizards with cut inflorescences than for (1) lizards above ground due to the greater risk above ground due to conspicuousness of black lizards on yellow flowers; and (2) lizards on ground away from flowers due to the cost of leaving while feeding. The only age-sex difference was slightly greater FID for adult males than subadults, presumably because larger adult males are more likely to be attacked by predators. Other potential factors affecting this difference are discussed. Experimental group and age-sex group did not interact for FID or DF. Because lizards foraging on inflorescences above ground fled to the base of the plants to refuge provided by spiny thistle leaves, their DF was shorter than in the other groups, which fled across the ground, usually without entering refuge. DF did not differ between groups on the ground or among age-sex groups. The predicted shorter DF for lizards with cut inflorescences than on ground without inflorescences did not occur.

Although optimality models predict the distance at which an animal should initiate vigilance and flight, many studies have shown that animals generally flee soon after detecting an approaching threat, supporting the 'flush early and avoid the risk' (FEAR) hypothesis. Despite this, flight behaviour varies markedly depending on context, suggesting some behavioural plasticity in the response of prey to a given threat. We evaluated the degree of plasticity in the flight responses of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, a highly flexible species which thrives in human-dominated landscapes. Based on individually identifiable animals and a standardized flight initiation protocol, we measured the distance at which a deer detected an approaching threat, and the distance at which it subsequently initiated flight. Our results provide strong support for the FEAR hypothesis, suggesting that alert and flight responses are strongly coupled in roe deer. However, the perceived level of both risk (in terms of landscape openness and proximity to human infrastructure) and reward (in terms of habitat quality) influenced the time it took for a deer to detect an approaching threat, and the subsequent time for which the threat was tolerated prior to flight. Overall, our findings indicate that although roe deer minimize monitoring costs when assessing risk by fleeing early, they also adjust their monitoring and flight responses to the local risk-resource trade-off.

Ten GPS-collared, free-ranging European hares, Lepus europaeus, were repeatedly subjected to a leashed dog and two humans in an experimental cross-over design. Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of the treatment and its interaction with vegetation parameters on the movement behaviour of the European hare. The reactive movement response was best explained by the model that included the interaction between elevated predation risk and vegetation structure. A strong immediate response was found in short vegetation up to 1 h after the treatment ended. The effect extended beyond the duration of the treatment and was synchronized with the resting and foraging period over the next 24 h. The distance covered between resting and foraging grounds was negatively affected, while use of less risky, low-quality vegetation during resting and foraging was favoured. Medium-sized prey species exhibit strong behavioural responses to the perceived predation risk, which we demonstrate here for the European hare. An elevated predation risk, for example by dogs, can trigger costly behavioural responses in these medium-sized prey species. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Lea_2011,"Lea, Amanda J.; Blumstein, Daniel T.",Age and sex influence marmot antipredator behavior during periods of heightened risk,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Animals adjust their antipredator behavior according to environmental variation in risk, and to account for their ability to respond to threats. Intrinsic factors that influence an animal's ability to respond to predators (e. g., age, body condition) should explain variation in antipredator behavior. For example, a juvenile might allocate more time to vigilance than an adult because mortality as a result of predation is often high for this age class; however, the relationship between age/vulnerability and antipredator behavior is not always clear or as predicted. We explored the influence of intrinsic factors on yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) antipredator behavior using data pooled from 4 years of experiments. We hypothesized that inherently vulnerable animals (e. g., young, males, and individuals in poor condition) would exhibit more antipredator behavior prior to and immediately following conspecific alarm calls. As expected, males and yearlings suppressed foraging more than females and adults following alarm call playbacks. In contrast to predictions, animals in better condition respond more than animals in below average condition. Interestingly, these intrinsic properties did not influence baseline time budgets; animals of all ages, sexes, and condition levels devoted comparable amounts of time to foraging prior to alarm calls. Our results support the hypothesis that inherent differences in vulnerability influence antipredator behavior; furthermore, it appears that a crucial, but poorly acknowledged, interaction exists between risk and state-dependence. Elevated risk may be required to reveal the workings of state-dependent behavior, and studies of antipredator behavior in a single context may draw incomplete conclusions about age-or sex-specific strategies.",2011,10.1007/s00265-011-1162-x,yes,ethology,exp,Marmota_flaviventris,rodent,mammal,direct_obs,61,,,92,100,AB,yes,vigilance,"predator_vigilance, alarm_call_playback","pooled from several studies over 4 years, not sure the temporal range is really fair",

We documented naturally-occurring vigilance throughout ontogeny, and used playback experiments to evaluate age-related variation in hyenas' responses to control sounds or lion roars. We inquired whether juveniles respond to lions more cautiously than do adults. Naturalistic observations showed that juveniles are less vigilant than adults when no immediate threat is present, but more vigilant than adults when lions are present. Our playback experiments revealed that both adult and juvenile hyenas moved in response to lion roars but not to control sounds, and their reactions were stronger to roars emitted by male than female lions. However, juveniles showed a stronger response to lions than adults, as expressed by spending more time avoiding speakers after roar onset, and by having a shorter latency to first movement than adults. Like adults, juvenile hyenas, thus, appear to recognize certain signals as dangerous and respond accordingly.

Beauchamp_2014,"Beauchamp, Guy",A field investigation of scrounging in semipalmated sandpipers,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Animals that forage in groups can produce their own food patches or scrounge the food discoveries of their companions. Mean tactic payoffs are expected to be the same at equilibrium for phenotypically equal foragers. Scrounging is also typically viewed as a risk-averse foraging strategy that provides a more even food intake rate over time. The occurrence of scrounging and the payoffs from different foraging modes have rarely been investigated in the field. Over two field seasons, I examined patch sharing in semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) foraging on minute food items at the surface of the substrate. Birds could find patches on their own, a producing event, or join the food patches discovered by others, a scrounging event. I found that the average search time per patch did not differ between producing and scrounging but that the average time spent exploiting a patch was reduced nearly by half when scrounging. As a result, the proportion of time spent exploiting a patch, a measure of foraging payoffs, was significantly lower when scrounging. The variance in payoffs was similar for producing and scrounging. When producing their own patches, individuals that scrounged spent the same proportion of time exploiting a patch as those that only produced. However, within the same individuals, the search time for a scrounged patch was longer than the search time for a produced patch. The results show unequal payoffs for producing and scrounging in this system and suggest that low success in finding patches elicited scrounging.",2014,10.1007/s00265-014-1755-2,yes,ethology,obs,Calidris_pusilla,shorebird,bird,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",,n/a,1,,12,AB,no,vigilance,producer_scrounger,"observations were only during foraging sessions, identifying the two different types - stopped recording when the bird did something else",

Searching allows animals to find food, mates, shelter and other resources essential for survival and reproduction and is thus among the most important activities performed by animals. Theory predicts that animals will use random search strategies in highly variable and unpredictable environments. Two prominent models have been suggested for animals searching in sparse and heterogeneous environments: (i) the Levy walk and (ii) the composite correlated random walk (CCRW) and its associated area-restricted search behaviour. Until recently, it was difficult to differentiate between the movement patterns of these two strategies. 2. Using a new method that assesses whether movement patterns are consistent with these two strategies and two other common random search strategies, we investigated the movement behaviour of three species inhabiting sparse northern environments: woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), barren-ground grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and polar bear (Ursus maritimus). These three species vary widely in their diets and thus allow us to contrast the movement patterns of animals from different feeding guilds. 3. Our results showed that although more traditional methods would have found evidence for the Levy walk for some individuals, a comparison of the Levy walk to CCRWs showed stronger support for the latter. While a CCRW was the best model for most individuals, there was a range of support for its absolute fit. A CCRW was sufficient to explain the movement of nearly half of herbivorous caribou and a quarter of omnivorous grizzly bears, but was insufficient to explain the movement of all carnivorous polar bears. 4. Strong evidence for CCRW movement patterns suggests that many individuals may use a multiphasic movement strategy rather than one-behaviour strategies such as the Levy walk. The fact that the best model was insufficient to describe the movement paths of many individuals suggests that some animals living in sparse environments may use strategies that are more complicated than those described by the standard random search models. Thus, our results indicate a need to develop movement models that incorporate factors such as the perceptual and cognitive capacities of animals.",2016,10.1111/1365-2656.12562,yes,telem,obs,"Rangifer_tarandus, Ursus_arctos, Ursus_maritimus","carnivore, ungulate",mammal,GPS,54,280000,,1544,643,BC,yes,movement,"random_walk, habitat_selection","foraging = intensive, area-restricted search movement paths",

In territorial species, the spatial dynamics of populations is to a large degree shaped by individuals' ranging behaviour during their juvenile dispersal. Here we use information on juvenile golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) tracked by satellite telemetry, to explore the effects of daily behavioural decisions on their dispersal strategy during their first year of life. When analysed on a biweekly basis, the large-scale movements of golden eagles did not differ from a correlated random walk (CRW) model of dispersal. Although in the long term such a strategy maximises the acquisition of information on good hunting areas, finding a mate and a vacant territory in a landscape, it is expensive in terms of energy requirements. At the finer scale of daily foraging movements, movement patterns were non-random, probably reflecting animals' oriented movements towards sites with high chances of successful hunting. We suggest that the key issue to take into account when exploring the factors determining individuals' dispersal strategies is how strongly the daily movements are influenced by an active search for food. This is to a large degree determined by food availability and individuals' ability to accumulate reserves. In our case, the individuals with the lowest proportion of foraging habitats within their dispersal areas showed large-scale movements more restricted than expected from a CRW.

This raises the possibility that hovering pollination may evolve more easily than previously believed, given sufficient selective pressure on plant traits, on nectarivory, or both. We observed foraging behavior by the sunbird Cyanomitra oritis at flowers of the native Old World plant Impatiens sakeriana. We measured the length of pedicels and peduncles (PedPed length), which can make the flowers difficult to reach while the bird perches on the stem, and determined if it influenced sunbird hovering or perching at a flower. Detailed analyses of video recordings showed that sunbirds only hovered at flowers with a long PedPed, whereas they employed both foraging modes when an adequate perch was available. A hovering sunbird could deplete nectar in a shorter time than a perching one. The frequency of visits was not greater at flowers with longer PedPed or with more open I. sakeriana flowers in the vicinity.

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that Old World nectarivores hover while feeding more frequently than previously thought, and some Old World plants seem to have adapted to hovering bird pollinators. To reveal the importance of sunbird foraging behavior in nectar acquisition and to test whether this behavior is determined by plant architecture and rain intensity, we focused on the specialized West African pollination system of Impatiens sakeriana and its two major pollinators, the Cameroon sunbird Cyanomitra oritis and the northern double-collared sunbird Cinnyris reichenowi. C. oritis hovered more often than C. reichenowi while feeding on flowers, although both species were observed hovering regularly. For both species, hovering reduced the feeding time, but this reduction and the consequent estimated changes in energetic intake were species-specific. We found that both floral pedicel and peduncle length, as well as precipitation, negatively affected the probability of C. reichenowi hovering but did not have any significant effect on the behavior of C. oritis. Our study demonstrates that hovering behavior is common in the studied sunbird taxa and that plant architecture and environmental factors can influence sunbird foraging behavior.

Therefore, rodent foraging preferences for certain seed traits (species, size, condition) have been extensively studied. However, to what extent these preferences are fixed or they track the temporal changes on seed characteristics due to phenological differences has been seldom explored. We studied the temporal variability in seed preferences by wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), according to phenological changes in seed characteristics of two co-occurring oaks (Quercus ilex and Quercus pubescens). The phenology of acorn abundance and the acorn predation/dispersal patterns by rodents were monitored over an entire seeding season. Results revealed temporal changes in rodent preferences for acorns of the two oaks, matching their different seeding phenology (earlier in Q. pubescens and later in Q. ilex). On the other hand, whatever the species considered, rodents preferred larger and sound acorns along the entire season, although the dispersal of infested ones increased slightly during the peaks of acorn drop. The observed influence of seeding phenology on seed choices by rodents warns about inferring definite conclusions regarding their foraging behavior when arising from short-term experiments. Indeed, this study reveals that foraging preferences may be highly dynamic and context-dependent for some seed traits (e.g., species and condition), rather than fixed behavioral patterns.

Although they are traditionally considered not as structured as moving mixed-species groups, the composition and organization of aggregations can be influenced both by competition and by information flow between species. Frugivorous birds, for example, might move towards vocalizations of other species as cues to resources. If they differentially respond to a combination of other species' vocalizations, an indication of a generalist fruiting tree, this could be a mechanism that creates nested structure in seed dispersal networks. We used both observational and experimental methods to study a community of frugivores in southwest China. Although the foraging niches of the birds highly overlapped, little interspecific aggression was found, suggesting a superabundant food resource. Birds were more attracted to playback of mass-fruiting trees, recorded when they were fruiting, than recordings made when those same trees were not fruiting. We compared attraction to the vocalizations of (a) an insectivorous species, (b, c, d) three species of frugivores, each presented separately, and (e) a combination of the frugivores in which their vocalizations were repeated sequentially. Response of heterospecific frugivores to the combination tape was significantly higher than to the insectivorous control, and tended (P = 0.068) to be higher than response to the frugivores. We suggest that this represents an indication that birds can use the diversity of vocalizations in a tree as a cue to understand the community of trees they interact with, as well as the community of birds. Significance statement To our knowledge, although now used frequently with mixed-species bird flocks, playback has not been used to explore whether frugivorous birds could use heterospecific vocalizations to find fruit. We present the results of a simple, realistic experiment that shows that respondents approach trees in which birds, the majority of which are heterospecifics, are vocalizing. The results from a more complicated, controlled experiment suggest that birds may preferentially be attracted to a combination of frugivores' sounds.

Although this relationship traditionally involves the consumption of prey, predators can also affect their prey through predator-induced alterations in foraging, habitat use, or morphology. These alterations in prey traits, resulting from non-consumptive effects, were investigated through different stimuli induced by artificial snakes on the anti-predator behavior of birds when foraging upon Morus nigra trees. Experiments were developed for each type of snakes static position reflected different states of foraging behavior adopted by snakes (i.e., sit-and-wait, coiled, and active foraging) using three treatments: artificial snake, snake-shaped mimicry, and control (i.e., no stimulus). Regardless of the behavior adopted by snakes, the models caused drastic changes to the behaviors of birds. The other treatments did not trigger behavioral changes, except for the snake-shaped mimicry treatment, which simulated a coiled snake. This study demonstrates how birds perceive and respond to different predator-like stimuli, highlighting the cognitive and behavioral abilities of vertebrates. Predators control prey populations through a combination of consumptive and non-consumptive effects. We investigated the effects of non-consumptive effects induced by different stimuli emitted by tree snakes on the anti-predatory behaviors of neotropical frugivorous birds when foraging upon M. nigra.

Here, we examine the relationships between dominance rank and energy intake and expenditure of female mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (Gorilla beringei beringei). Bwindi gorillas have weak dominance relationships, feed on nonreproductive plant parts throughout the year, and consume fruit when it is seasonally available. We used behavioral observations on one group of gorillas and nutritional analysis of their major food items to calculate energy intake rates and estimated energy expenditure. Using linear mixed models, we found a significant positive relationship between dominance rank and energy intake rates, due to higher-ranking females having faster ingestion rates, rather than consuming foods with higher energy concentrations. Lower-ranking females did not spend significantly more time feeding to compensate for their lower energy intake rates. Lower-ranking females spent significantly more time traveling than higher-ranking females, leading to a negative relationship between dominance rank and energy expenditure. The combined results revealed a significant positive relationship between dominance rank and energy balance. Higher-ranking females did not spend longer feeding on fruit than lower-ranking ones, and the relationship between dominance rank and energy intake rates was not stronger when fruit was available.

Generally, time spent bedded is considered a proxy for time spent ruminating. Researchers rarely include measures of interindividual differences in the intensity and time spent ruminating. We explored individual variation in rumination behaviour in Rocky mountain bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We expected rumination to be a plastic behaviour affected by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as body mass, age, sex, reproductive status and environmental conditions. We investigated rumination behaviour based on (1) mean number of chews per bolus of food (chews/bolus), (2) mean number of chews per second per bolus (chewing rate) and (3) mean time spent chewing per bolus (bolus processing time) for sheep of known age, sex, body mass and reproductive status. Our results show that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affected rumination behaviour. Females tended to spend less time processing each bolus than males of similar body mass, resulting in a significantly higher chewing rate for females. There was no difference in chews/bolus between sexes. Environmental factors and group size also affected rumination behaviour: cold temperatures were associated with fewer chews/bolus; wind was associated with more chews/bolus. Sheep in larger groups had a slower rate of rumination than those in smaller groups. We conclude that rumination behaviour is very plastic and, therefore, that assumptions of uniform rumination rates across individuals may be misleading and may miss an important piece of ruminants' foraging ecology.

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon but, so far, no study investigated the proximate mechanisms underlying rut-induced hypophagia in ungulates using alternative mating tactics (AMTs). Between the pre-rut and post-rut of 2011 and 2012, we collected data on activity budgets, parasite burden and androgen levels of territorial and non-territorial male Alpine chamois Rupicapra r. rupicapra in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). We aimed to investigate whether AMTs showed similar reduction in time spent foraging during the mating period and to test the predictions underlying alternative hypotheses that may explain rut-induced hypophagia. Only territorial males showed a significant reduction in time spent foraging during the rut; the lack of correlation between proportion of time spent foraging and androgen metabolites or parasite burden did not fully support the physiological and the parasite hypotheses, while the foraging constraint, the energy-saving and the physical rest hypotheses could not be discounted. Territorial males decreased the time spent lying down from the pre-rut to the rut, but not their foraging-to-lying-down ratio. During the mating period, we found negative correlations between time spent foraging or lying down and time spent rutting. Our data suggest that territorial males' behaviour is more consistent with the foraging constraint hypothesis than with the energy-saving hypothesis previously suggested. Yet, during the rut territorial males did not maximise their foraging time, and the optimisation of their energy balance could rather depend upon feeding on relatively high-quality plants. This suggestion - possibly named forage quality hypothesis' - now requires further investigations.

Short-term responses to high air temperatures can allow animals to conserve water while maintaining a safe body temperature. For birds, cooling is often through evaporative water loss, which can be physiologically costly. Microsite use is an effective means of conserving water via reducing environmental heat load, so long as there are no negative trade-offs with other necessary functions, such as foraging. We examined behavioural responses to temperature in Cape rockjumpers, Chaetops frenatus (hereafter: 'rockjumper'), an alpine specialist bird. We hypothesized that rockjumper behaviours would be temperature and microsite dependent.

Rockjumpers made increased use of rock shade as air temperature increased. However, birds in rock shade foraged less. Depending on where their main food source is located, this suggests that when foraging demands are high, birds may need to remain in the sun despite risks of high thermal load, or else may suffer costs of lost foraging opportunities when using shade. The relationship between air temperature and heat dissipation behaviour (panting) was also mediated by microsite: birds showed significant increases in panting with increasing air temperature only when in the sun. The lack of increase in panting for birds in rock shade suggests that shade seeking may buffer physiological thermoregulatory costs (i.e. water expenditure). Individuals may therefore be able to mitigate some potential negative effects of high temperatures by making use of cooler microsites, although this could come at a cost to foraging.

Just like meat, the insides of hard-shelled nuts are high in energetic value, and both foods are difficult to acquire. In the Tai forest, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and red river hogs (Potamochoerus porcus) crack nuts by using tools or strong jaws, respectively. In this study, previously collected non-invasive camera trap data were used to investigate scavenging by sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), two species of Guinea fowl (Agelestres meleagrides; Guttera verreauxi), and squirrels (Scrunidae spp.) on the nut remnants cracked by chimpanzees and red river hogs. We investigated how scavengers located nut remnants, by analyzing their visiting behavior in relation to known nut-cracking events. Furthermore, since mangabeys are infrequently preyed upon by chimpanzees, we investigated whether they perceive an increase in predation risk when approaching nut remnants. In total, 190 nut-cracking events were observed in four different areas of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. We could confirm that mangabeys scavenged on the nuts cracked by chimpanzees and hogs and that this enabled them to access food source that would not be accessible otherwise. We furthermore found that mangabeys, but not the other species, were more likely to visit nut-cracking sites after nut-cracking activities than before, and discuss the potential strategies that the monkeys could have used to locate nut remnants. In addition, mangabeys showed elevated levels of vigilance at the chimpanzee nut-cracking sites compared with other foraging sites, suggesting that they perceived elevated danger at these sites. Scavenging on remnants of cracked nuts is a hitherto understudied type of foraging behavior that could be widespread in nature and increases the complexity of community ecology in tropical rainforests. By use of camera trap videos it was confirmed that mangabeys scavenge on the nut remnants cracked by chimpanzees and red river hogs. Squirrels and two types of guinea fowl might scavenge on these nut remnants but this could not be seen clearly. Looking at the visitation rate before and after nut cracking events it was found that the possible scavenging species were more present at the nut cracking sites after a nut cracking event took place. It was found that mangabeys have an increase in vigilance behavior at chimpanzee nut cracking sites compared with outside these chimpanzee nut cracking sites, indicating that the mangabeys perceive a higher risk at these nut cracking sites.",2018,10.1002/ajp.22895,yes,camera traps,obs,Cercocebus_atys,primate,mammal,camera_trap,n/a,73 points,0.416666667,,365,AB,no,vigilance,"scavenging, natural_history","cameras were out for up to 1 year, 10h of video were analysed...",

Individuals may benefit from lateralization if it allows them to perform complex tasks simultaneously. Studies on laterality further suggest that sex and age can influence the extent of lateralization. However, most studies on lateralization have been performed on captive individuals, exposed to simplified environments and expressing limited behavioural repertoire. Here, we evaluated behavioural lateralization in the greater flamingo, Phoenicopterus roseus, through observations of wild individuals 5-37 years old. We examined the lateralization of simple behaviours (resting postures) and of several demanding behaviours requiring enhanced motor control and coordination (stamping for food and five courtship postures). Resting postures were not lateralized. In contrast, nearly all flamingos were completely lateralized for stamping, with a significant predominance of right-footed individuals. During courtship displays, twist-preens were significantly lateralized, yet with no dominant laterality at the population level. Finally, we detected a slight positive effect of age on the intensity of twist-preen lateralization, which may be related to the increased complexity of courtship displays with age in this species. Our results support the hypothesis that lateralization manifests in complex behaviours, even in wild animals. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How these patchy infections first develop and whether seed dispersers also contribute to aggregated mistletoe distributions at landscape and regional scales have not been evaluated. Here we predict the mistletoe seed shadow of a dietary generalist (spiny-cheeked honeyeater Acanthagenys rufogularis Aves: Meliphagidae), by combining our observations of movements via radio telemetry with previous data on gut passage times to estimate seed dispersal curves for individual birds. There was considerable variation in movements and inferred seed dispersal between individuals, with non-breeding birds predicted to regularly transport Amyema quandang (Santalales: Loranthaceae) seeds up to 700 m; well beyond the boundaries of an existing mistletoe infection. As the first work to consider explicitly the distance component of mistletoe seed dispersal by dietary generalists, this study poses further questions about the relative seed dispersal roles of dietary generalists and mistletoe specialists.

Animals should therefore be more reluctant to leave a foraging patch when their energy reserves are low and should flee using low-energy escape tactics, but be quicker to flee and use the best escape tactic when satiated. Nectarivorous birds have little capacity for energy storage; thus, they should be particularly sensitive to variation in nutritional status throughout the day. We tested whether New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) alter their antipredator behavior by testing whether flight initiation distance (FID-the distance at which an individual flees from an approaching predator) and escape tactic (hopping or flying) vary over the course of the day. Honeyeater FID was shortest in the morning, following the overnight fast, and longest at midday. In the evening, though FID tended to shorten, responses were more variable overall, likely due to individual variation in foraging success. In the morning, honeyeaters were equally likely to hop or fly when approached, but increasingly favored flight as the day progressed. These results suggest a strong link between individual energetic condition and antipredator responses. We suggest that time of day is a useful and important variable influencing escape behavior, the potential effects of which should be more consistently considered as a covariate in the widely used FID protocol.",2019,10.1007/s00265-019-2757-x,yes,ethology,exp,Phylidonyris_novaehollandiae,passerine,bird,direct_obs,86,n/a,,1,12,A,no,vigilance,"simulated_predator, FID, antipredator_response",the birds were foraging before being scared,

Here, we contrast metrics of resource selection based on Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry, which indexes time spent in various habitats, with tracking in snow, which measures distance travelled. When animals move at different speeds within different habitats, the two methods can produce different results. The study was conducted in winter on endangered mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in a landscape fragmented by forestry roads and cutblocks. From 2001 to 2009, 25 caribou were monitored with GPS collars obtaining locations every two to six hours, and compared to 63 caribou trails followed in snow in the same study area and time period. Logistic regression was used to estimate selection for both metrics, with the same definition of use and availability employed. Forest age, tree species, edge distances, and road densities were the covariates of interest. For most covariates, the two metrics produced similar results that agreed with the literature: selection for primary forest stands that represent forage patches. Both metrics indicated selection for habitat edges that potentially enhance foraging. The distance metric (snow trailing) indicated strong selection for forestry roads (42% more than available), whereas GPS locations suggested an avoidance of roads (33% less than available). The GPS analysis was in agreement with the vast majority of work published on woodland caribou, whereas the distance metric suggests some of the first evidence of selection for anthropogenic linear features. Our results highlight a potential bias against detecting selection for habitat features used for movement when using long fix intervals (> 2 h) that typify most GPS studies. Avoidance of linear features should be carefully examined and designs considered to asses this bias.

Compared to scroungers, producers often occupy more dangerous outer spatial positions in the group, but they benefit from the finder's advantage, which is the amount of food eaten before the arrival of others. Scroungers may occupy safer positions but they face feeding competition when joining a patch already occupied by others. Here, we report factors influencing intragroup spatial position, feeding strategies and feeding success for a group of wild vervet monkeys, C. pygerythrus, at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. We collected data using behavioural observations and field experimentation (N 1/4 132 trials) where we set up an artificial food patch with dispersed food rewards. We found that individuals who spent more time in the front-outer position of a moving group produced more. Producers that had a greater finder's time advantage (fed undetected by group members for longer periods) had a greater finder's advantage (consumed more food items before the arrival of other group members), and scroungers that arrived earlier had greater overall feeding success. We found that when the scrounger was higher ranking than other individuals at the patch, they used displacement scrounging (supplanted at least one individual from the patch to gain access to the food resource). However, feeding success did not differ between displacement scrounging and tolerated scrounging (when the scrounger fed at the patch with at least one other individual). Interestingly, we did not find higher-ranking individuals to have greater feeding success than lower-ranking individuals. Our findings corroborate previous studies showing that even among species with a linear dominance hierarchy and high occurrences of within-group contest competition, dominant individuals do not benefit from feeding advantages at large, dispersed food patches since they cannot monopolize the resource. Furthermore, our results emphasize the need to understand factors influencing feeding tolerance, particularly for subordinate individuals, who need to process ecological and social elements to maximize their food acquisition.

Intergroup tolerance and cooperation are regarded as a crucial step in the formation of highly structured multilevel societies. Behavioral ecological theory suggests that intergroup tolerance and cooperation can emerge either when the costs of hostility outweigh the benefits of exclusive resource access or when both groups gain fitness benefits through their interactions. However, the factors promoting intergroup tolerance are still unclear due to the paucity of data on intergroup interactions in tolerant species. Here, we examine how social and ecological factors affect the onset and termination of intercommunity encounters in two neighboring communities of wild bonobos, a species exhibiting flexible patterns of intergroup interactions, at Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We recorded the timing and location of intercommunity encounters and measured fruit abundance and distribution, groups' social characteristics, and space-use dynamics over a 19-month period. We found that intercommunity tolerance was facilitated by a decrease in feeding competition, with high fruit abundance increasing the likelihood of communities to encounter, and high clumpiness of fruit patches increasing the probability to terminate encounters likely due to increased contest. In addition, the possibility for extra-community mating, as well as the potential benefits of more efficient foraging in less familiar areas, reduced the probability that the communities terminated encounters. By investigating the factors involved in shaping relationships across groups, this study contributes to our understanding of how animal sociality can extend beyond the group level. Lay Summary: Neighboring bonobo groups encounter each other more often when high abundance of fruits reduces feeding competition between them. When additional benefits, such as extra-group mating opportunities and potential improved foraging in less familiar areas emerge, even long-lasting intergroup associations can develop. By extending tolerant interactions beyond the group level, mechanisms such as those we describe in bonobos can lay the basis for the formation of complexly structured multilevel societies in animals.",2020,10.1093/beheco/arz214,yes,ethology,obs,Pan_paniscus,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, ethogram, all_day_follow",48,n/a,325.875,,579.5,ABC,yes,ethogram,social,followed the two groups average 27.5 days/month! 48 bonobos across two groups,
Marino_2010,"Marino, Andrea",Costs and Benefits of Sociality Differ Between Female Guanacos Living in Contrasting Ecological Conditions,ETHOLOGY,"According to current theory, anti-predator benefits promote group formation in open-dwelling ungulates. An inverse relationship between vigilance effort and group size has been documented frequently and thought to reflect the consequent decrease in perceived predation risk as group size increases. In contrast, competition costs are supposed to set the upper limit to the number of individuals that can forage together. As anti-predator behavior is no longer functional in the absence of predation and competition costs might be affected by resource distribution, the net benefit of aggregation will depend on the particular combination of predation risk and habitat structure experienced by the individual. To test this hypothesis, group-size effects on female time allocation and within-group aggression rate were compared between two guanaco populations exposed to contrasting levels of puma predation. Habitat structure within both sites consisted of mosaics of shrublands and grasslands, and group-size effects were also compared between these habitat types. Females under predation risk showed a strong reduction in vigilance as the number of adults in the group increased, whereas females from the predator-free population showed overall low levels of vigilance, regardless of group size. These results emphasize the anti-predator significance of the group-size effect on female vigilance, as well as guanaco plasticity to adjust time allocation to local conditions. On the other hand, within-group aggression rate increased with the number of adults in the group. Aggression rate was almost null within groups located in grasslands but was significantly higher in shrublands, regardless of predation risk, suggesting that the more heterogeneous distribution of shrubs increases the interference competition level. These results strengthen the notion of predation pressure and habitat structure as major determinants of the balance between costs and benefits of group living, and highlight the potential of individual behavioral patterns to make qualitative predictions about group-size variation within territorial ungulates.",2010,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01812.x,yes,ethology,obs,Lama_guanicoe,ungulate,mammal,direct_obs,63,n/a,0.076388889,,123,AB,no,vigilance,social,"total area of study site is >600km2, but obs were only made from a road (how long? how wide either side?) - certainly much less than this, but unclear how much",

Using a semiexperimental approach, we compared before, during, and after weekends: 1) the type and intensity of human activities and 2) the behavior and 3) physiological stress (fecal corticosterone metabolites) of wintering birds. Higher rates of human activity, in particular those related to hunting, occurred during weekends and caused indirect disturbance effects on birds. Little bustards spent more time vigilant and flying during weekends, and more time foraging in the mornings after weekend, possibly to compensate for increased energy expenditure during weekends. We also found increased physiological stress levels during weekends, as shown by higher fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Increased corticosterone metabolite levels were associated with the highest levels of hunting-related disturbances. Little bustard showed marked behavioral and physiological (stress hormones) responses to human activities that peaked during weekends, in particular hunting.

Few studies have distinguished between vigilance types when examining the effects of predation risk and, in the absence of a commonly accepted conceptual framework, the variables used to define predation risk vary greatly between studies. We investigated the relative importance of four predation risk categories (risky place assessed at the landscape and habitat level, vegetation characteristics at foraging site level, prey characteristics and resource availability) for the time spent on intense and routine vigilance by Burchell's zebra, Equus quagga burchellii, and blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus taurinus, under predation risk from reintroduced predators, lions, Panthera leo. The risk categories each represented a different predation risk component and included metrics that defined the component at multiple scales. Intense vigilance responses were scale dependent, with zebra responding to a risky place at the landscape level and wildebeest to vegetation characteristics at a foraging area scale. Yet both species were able to adjust and balance time spent on vigilance types. Prey characteristics reduced the intense vigilance of wildebeest as herd size increased. Both species maintained similar levels of intense vigilance between seasons, despite lower resource availability, and thus higher foraging costs, in the dry season. However, the reduction in grass quality probably resulted in the increase in routine vigilance by both species during the dry season, as more time was needed to chew grasses with high fibre content. Our findings suggest different underlying mechanisms for the two types of vigilance behaviour, which were influenced by the ecology of the species, and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing vigilance types in predation risk studies.

In extreme cases, such alterations may have serious demographic consequences, and recent studies support that non-lethal effects of predation may have broad ecological consequences. However, behavioural and physiological responses to predation risk may be related to trade-offs associated with resource acquisition and direct predation risk. We validated an enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) for non-invasive monitoring of stress in plains zebras (Equus quagga) from faecal material. We used this assay in combination with behavioural data to assess if plains zebras living with and without lions (Panthera leo) in a mountain savannah in southern Africa differed in behaviour and physiology, and if such differences were influenced by seasons with contrasting resource availability. Zebra group sizes did not differ between areas with and without lions, but zebra groups had more juveniles in an area with lions than groups in an area without lions, but only during the wet season. Similarly, we observed differences in individual vigilance, foraging behaviour and stress hormone concentrations, but all these differences were influenced by seasons. Despite these seasonal influences, our study did not suggest that zebras in an area with lions spent a higher proportion of time being vigilant, a lower proportion of time foraging, or had higher stress hormone levels. Our results instead suggest that zebras' responses to lion presence were highly context dependent and the result of complex interactions between resource abundance and cues about predation risk.

Both species exhibit fission-fusion dynamics, but chimpanzees, particularly in East African populations, appear to experience higher feeding competition than bonobos. We expected lactating chimpanzees to be less gregarious than lactating bonobos; reduced gregariousness should allow lactating chimpanzees to mitigate the costs of higher feeding competition without requiring more foraging effort. However, we expected the reduced gregariousness of lactating chimpanzees to limit their time available for affiliative interactions.

On separate occasions, we used flight-initiation distance tests to measure boldness in our kangaroos. Females with longer flight-initiation distances (shyer females) spent more time vigilant, providing preliminary support for studies of animal personality that have suggested that boldness may covary with vigilance. Body condition did not affect the total time spent vigilant, but females in poorer body condition spent more of their vigilance time in low-intensity vigilance. Vigilance patterns were not related to reproductive state, but varied among months and differed between mornings and afternoons, and females spent more time in high-intensity vigilance when further from cover.

How extrinsic (e.g., predator activity within certain habitats) and intrinsic (e.g., within-group competition) cues interact depends on the biology of the prey species. However, very little is known about the impact of the actual presence of the predator in the vicinity on fine scale prey vigilance behavior. For this study, we monitored the vigilance of plains zebra (Equus quagga) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) in and around Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We assessed how the presence of radio-collared lions (Panthera leo) affected the vigilance of their prey. To evaluate the factors affecting vigilance behavior, we measured routine and intense vigilance. Routine vigilance can be conducted while chewing, although during intense vigilance chewing is halted and thus imposes foraging costs as food processing is delayed. As the most acute form of vigilance, we predicted that the presence of lions would lead to an increase in intense vigilance in both species. We found this to be the case for zebra, a key prey species for lions, while impala adjusted their intense vigilance to risk cues less specific to the presence of lions. Potential predation risk posed by lions in the immediate vicinity differs not only between species but also for a given species in different contexts.

Han_2020,"Han, Lei; Blank, David; Wang, Muyang; Yang, Weikang","Vigilance behaviour in Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica): Effect of group size, group type, sex and age",BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES,"Gregarious prey species modify their behaviours in response to predation risk in two ways: by increasing vigilance level or enlarging herd size. However, individuals of various sex and age have different responses to the same danger, and even the same individuals react differently depending on their status during biological events or within group types. But how these factors influence the interactions between vigilance level and group size is still poorly understood. Therefore, we studied this phenomenon by observing and analyzing the behaviours of the Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) in the Eastern Tian-Shan Mountains (China). We found that similar to many other gregarious ungulates, Siberian ibex demonstrated a decrease in vigilance level with an increase in group size, since staying in larger groups increased the probability of predator detection and reduced the possibility of being captured. In general, males were more vigilant than females during the rut due to the sharp increase in their social alertness to achieve greater success in reproduction. In contrast, females were more vigilant than males out of rutting time, particularly significantly following parturition, since mothers spent a lot of their energy in maternal care, which coupled with having small and unexperienced newborns, made them more vulnerable to predation than other conspecifics. Siberian ibex had the same vigilance level in summer and winter, because of seasonally opposite trade-offs between feeding duration and vigilance level based on seasonal changes in food availability. Individuals in mixed-sex and female groups were more often targeted by predators, prompting individuals from these groups to be more vigilant than in male groups. The vigilance level in males decreased with age likely because of their increased body size and enhanced vigilance experience, which reduced their risk of predation. Our study confirmed that the Siberian ibex' vigilance level inversely correlated with group size, but other various factors, such as forage biomass/quality, sex, biological cycle, group types and age, had significant impacts on their interrelationship.",2020,10.1016/j.beproc.2019.104021,yes,ethology,obs,Capra_sibirica,ungulate,mammal,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",596,200,15.08333333,,365,AB,no,vigilance,"social, activity_budget","20km transect, assuming 5km vis on either side? 1700 total study area",

Evidence of a role for intrasexual competition in sentinel behavior,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Although the evolutionary mechanisms that favor investment in cooperative behaviors have long been a focus of research, comparatively few studies have considered the role that sexual selection may play. For example, evolutionary explanations for sentinel behavior (where 1 individual assumes an elevated position and scans the surroundings while other group members forage nearby) have traditionally focused on the inclusive fitness benefits arising from its effects on predation risk, while its potential role in defense against intrasexual competitors remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide experimental evidence of a role for sentinel behavior in intrasexual competition, in a cooperatively breeding songbird, the white-browed sparrow weaver (Plocepasser mahali). First, dominant males sentinel substantially more than other group members (even when controlling for variation in age and body condition), consistent with a role for sentineling in intrasexual competition for mates and/or territory. Second, experimental playback of an unfamiliar male's solo song elicited a marked increase in sentineling by the dominant male, and the vocal response to the playback also positively predicted his sentinel effort following the simulated intrusion. A second experiment also suggests that sentineling may facilitate mounting rapid anti-intruder responses, as responses to intruder-playback occurred significantly earlier when the dominant male was sentineling rather than foraging at playback onset. Together, our findings provide rare support for the hypothesis that sentinel behavior plays a role in intrasexual competition, and so highlight the potential for sexually selected direct benefits to shape its expression in this and other social vertebrates.",2016,10.1093/beheco/arw064,yes,ethology,"obs, exp",Plocepasser_mahali,passerine,bird,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",25,n/a,0.088333333,2,450,AB,yes,vigilance,"social, activity_budget, alarm_call_playback",,

Anthropogenic processes such as agricultural development directly affect the ecological challenges that species face. In agriculturaleforest ecotones cultivated foods that are palatable, energy-rich, easily digestible, and that often occur as large, clumped and spatially abundant orchards or fields may offer foraging advantages over natural foods. However, crop raiding can be risky: harassment, injury or even death may arise from confrontations with people. The factors that affect grouping decisions and activity budgets within anthropogenic environments are unknown. Twelve months of focal data were collected from direct observations of one chimpanzee community inhabiting a forestefarm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea. Wild fruit abundance did not directly influence daily party size. Instead, cultivated resource consumption, in combination with other social factors, provided chimpanzees with an alternative to fissioning. Chimpanzee party size did not differ between crop raids and wild feeds, but party cohesiveness did increase during raids. Furthermore, males and females adapted their activity budgets in different ways to integrate cultivated resources into their broader ecological strategy. As species are increasingly forced into anthropogenically impacted habitats, models of fissionefusion dynamics and other socioecological adaptations need to take into account exploitation of cultivated, energy-rich crops.

For terrestrial social animals, predation, feeding success, and social competition are thought to be three of the most important variables. The relative importance of these three factors was investigated in groups of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) in IguazA(0), Argentina. Different age/sex classes responded differently to these three variables. Coatis were found in close proximity to their own age/sex class more often than random, and three out of four age/sex classes were found to exhibit within-group spatial position preferences which differed from random. Juveniles were located more often at the front edge and were rarely found at the back of the group. Juveniles appeared to choose spatial locations based on feeding success and not predation avoidance. Since juveniles are the most susceptible to predation and presumably have less prior knowledge of food source location, these results have important implications in relation to predator-sensitive foraging and models of democratic group leadership. Subadults were subordinate to adult females, and their relationships were characterized by high levels of aggression. This aggression was especially common during the first half of the coati year (Nov-April), and subadults were more peripheralized during this time period. Subadults likely chose spatial positions to avoid aggression and were actively excluded from the center of the group by adult females. In the IguazA(0) coati groups, it appeared that food acquisition and social agonism were the major determinants driving spatial choice, while predation played little or no role. This paper demonstrates that within-group spatial structure can be a complex process shaped by differences in body size and nutritional requirements, food patch size and depletion rate, and social dominance status.

One possibility is to not randomly learn from any social partner but mainly from specific role models like for example the mother or high ranking group members. A potential mechanism for such directed social learning could be that individuals observe the actions of role models more often than of other group members. Field experiments showed that in vervet monkeys - a species with female philopatry - dominant females are more closely watched than dominant males in an artificial fruit-type social learning task. Here, we quantified social attention to males and females under natural conditions in six groups of vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) at Loskop Dam Nature Reserve, South Africa. Using the focal sampling method, we quantified the frequencies with which all adult individuals were observed by other group members of known age class, rank, sex and degree of relatedness during foraging bouts and grooming interactions. We found that group members generally paid more attention to females than to males. This effect remained when we excluded matriline members from the analyses.

Studies indicate that animals are influenced by social context during exploration and are able to learn socially. Carrion and hooded crows, which are opportunistic generalists with flexible social systems, have so far received little focus in this area. We combined observational and experimental approaches to investigate social interactions during foraging and social influences on crow behaviour within a free-ranging population at Vienna Zoo, which included 115 individually marked crows. We expected the crows to be tolerant of conspecifics during foraging due to high food abundance. We predicted that social context would enhance familiar object exploration, as well as a specific foraging strategy: predation by crows on other species. We found that crows were highly tolerant of one another, as reflected by their high rates of cofeeding - where they fed directly beside conspecific(s) - relative to affiliative or agonistic interactions. Evidence for social facilitation - when the observer's behaviour is affected by the mere presence of a model - was found in both object exploration and predation behaviour. Specifically, crows touched the objects more frequently when others were present (whilst only approaching the objects when alone), and conspecifics were present more frequently during predation events involving the high-risk target species. Evidence for enhancement during object exploration - where the observer's attention is drawn to a place or object by a model's actions - was not confirmed in this context. Our results highlight the role played by the presence of conspecifics across different contexts: natural foraging behaviour, familiar object exploration and a specific foraging strategy.

Here, we test predictions from 3 socioecological hypotheses regarding the evolution of these traits using data on wild bonobos at LuiKotale, Democratic Republic of Congo. Focusing on the behavior of co-feeding females and controlling for variation in characteristics of the feeding patch, food intake rate moderately increased while feeding effort decreased with female dominance rank, indicating that females engaged in competitive exclusion from high-quality food resources. However, these rank effects did not translate into variation in energy balance, as measured from urinary C-peptide levels. Instead, energy balance varied independent of female rank with the proportion of fruit in the diet. Together with the observation that females join forces in conflicts with males, our results support the hypothesis that predicts that females trade off feeding opportunities for safety against male aggression.

We recorded the risk management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals. These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior. Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity, suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context, potentially removing these differences.",2012,10.1093/beheco/arr185,yes,ethology,obs,Tringa_totanus,shorebird,bird,"direct_obs, focal_sampling, ethogram",23,0.15,0.098460145,,80,AB,yes,ethogram,"social, activity_budget, individual_differences",,

Animals migrating outside of protected areas can be exposed to greater human pressure, and this effect can be stronger when humans are perceived to be a predation risk, such as during hunting seasons. Using four consecutive years of satellite telemetry data (n = 138 migration events), we compared habitat selection, movement, and behavior of a large partially migratory herbivore while migrating through a heterogeneous landscape in spring and fall. We tested the hypothesis that fall hunting exacerbates the response of a large herbivore exposed to human disturbance while migrating through a road network. All elk (Cervus elaphus) selected greater forest cover, reduced movement rates, and avoided roads during fall-day than in any other season or time of day. Avoidance of roads was reduced during spring at night, for example, the time period of no hunting with fewest people on roads. Elk using stopovers in fall displayed different seasonal and diurnal behaviors between sexes in response to the disturbance. Females used steeper terrain during fall-day and males did not use this strategy in fall. Male avoidance of roads was much stronger than females during fall-day and males were less likely to cross a road during fall. Such responses are probably linked to higher hunting pressure on males vs. females. Finally, we found that elk spent more time feeding during spring migration compared to the fall migration and elk vigilance was > 3 times higher in the fall hunting season. Our results provide insights into the effect of fear of humans on the ecology of both sexes of a migrating large herbivore when using stopovers.

Time allocation to different activities and displays of aggressive behavior were compared between territorial and bachelor male guanacos within two populations with contrasting levels of predation risk. Territorial males devoted almost twice the time than bachelors to vigilance and moving, at the expense of foraging time. Aggressive interactions were more frequent and severe for territorial males than for bachelors, based on observation. These differences were larger during the reproductive season but remained statistically significant after this period, highlighting the extended effort towards territorial defense beyond the peak of reproductive activity.

Firstly, individuals in larger groups may be more likely to encounter food sites where other group members have already eaten, leading to greater asynchronous individual travel to find fresh sites. Secondly, when food sites are aggregated into patches, larger groups may need to visit more patches to obtain the same amount of food per capita, leading to greater synchronous group travel between patches. If the first mechanism can be mitigated by increasing group spread, then we expect the second mechanism to be more sensitive to group size. Here, we examine the individual travel and group travel of the Virunga mountain gorillas, along with potential implications for the two mechanisms of scramble competition. Asynchronous individual travel accounted for 67% of the total travel time, and the remainder arose from group travel. Group spread increased significantly for larger groups, but not enough to prevent an increase in individual travel. Contrary to expectations, group travel decreased with size among most groups, and we found only limited evidence of patch depletion that would cause the second mechanism of scramble competition. Collectively, our results illustrate how the influence of group size can differ for individual travel versus group travel, just as it differs among species for overall travel. Studies that distinguish between the two mechanisms of scramble competition may enhance our understanding of ecological constraints upon group size, including potential differences between frugivores and folivores. Significance statement Feeding competition provides insight into how group size can influence the foraging patterns of social animals, but two key mechanisms are not typically compared. Firstly, larger groups may visit more patches to access the same amount of food per capita (group travel). Secondly, their individuals may also need to move past more spots where another member has already eaten (individual travel). Contrary to expectations, we found that group travel decreased with size for most groups of mountain gorillas, which may reflect extra travel by smaller groups to avoid larger groups. Individual travel increased with size in most groups, even though gorillas in larger groups compensated by spreading out over a broader area. The two mechanisms revealed patterns that were not apparent in our previous study of overall travel.

Among species with intense within-group feeding competition and high costs of reproduction, females are expected to experience reduced foraging efficiency by associating with males, and this may compromise their reproductive ability. Here, we test this hypothesis in chimpanzees, a species with flexible grouping patterns in which female avoidance of large subgroups has been attributed to their relatively high costs of grouping. In an > 11-year study of the Kanyawara community of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, the availability of sexually receptive females was a key determinant of the number of males in parties. In turn, females experienced significantly lower C-peptide of insulin levels, indicative of reduced energy balance, during periods when they associated with more males. Female associates did not produce the same negative effect. C-peptide levels positively and significantly predicted female ovarian steroid production, indicating that the costs of associating with males can lead to downstream reproductive costs. Therefore, we conclude that Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibit sexual conflict over subgroup formation, with the large groupings that allow males to compete for mating opportunities inflicting energetic and reproductive costs on females. Because association with males is central to female chimpanzees' anti-infanticide strategy, and males may confer other benefits, we propose that reproductive success in female chimpanzees hinges on a delicate balance between the costs and benefits of associating with male conspecifics.",2014,10.1007/s00265-014-1803-y,yes,ethology,obs,Pan_troglodytes,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, instantaneous_scan",25,n/a,1.463333333,,750,AB,no,ethogram,"social, all_day_follow","indiv-specific foraging was not collected, indivs were IDd but foraging was pooled within groups",

Here, we evaluated the role of the non-vocal sound produced by scaled doves (Columbina squammata) during escape takeoffs. Initially, we investigated the context of the non-vocal sound production to access the effects of natural threats on individuals' escape response. Then, we used simulated attacks (a direct running movement toward the focal individuals) to confirm the preliminary observations and to evaluate how position in the group affects escape response and vigilance. For both the observational and experimental parts, we registered, among other variables, the occurrence of takeoff flight, if it was followed by a production of non-vocal sound, the position of the individuals within the flock and their response (e.g., stay, flew, vigilance). We observed that both solitary and flocked individuals produce non-vocal sounds during takeoff flights, although it was more commonly registered for flocks. The production of the non-vocal sound elicited a faster escape response on flock members, and individuals at the center of the flock showed a higher probability to takeoff. The results suggest that the non-vocal sound may signal information about predation risk and that it may be directed both to conspecifics and to the predator itself.

There was no sex difference in individual vigilance in feral goats, but foraging efficiency was higher in females than in males. Goats were more vigilant in fall than in summer.

Kern_2021,"Kern, Julie M.; Radford, Andrew N.",Strongly bonded individuals prefer to forage together in cooperatively breeding dwarf mongoose groups,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"In many social species, group members form strong social bonds. Such strong bonds are well-known to generate long-term fitness benefits, but they are also expected to influence short-term behavioural decisions. Here, we use field observations and an experimental manipulation to investigate whether variation in social-bond strength (as determined from grooming interactions) influences nearest-neighbour choices while foraging in wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). Preferred grooming partnerships (PGPs), representing particularly strong bonds, were found predominately between male-female dyads but among a range of dominance-status dyads. When searching for food, dwarf mongooses with PGPs were more likely than expected by chance to forage close to a preferred grooming partner. Foraging near a strongly bonded groupmate might reduce the predation risk or increase foraging opportunities and the transfer of social information. In addition, there could be stress-reducing benefits, although our field experiment provided no evidence that nearest-neighbour preferences for strongly bonded groupmates were additionally favoured, or indeed disrupted, in the aftermath of a short-term stressful event. Investigating the potential influence of strong social bonds on short-term behavioural decisions with potential fitness consequences is important for our understanding of social interactions and cooperation. Significance statement Enduring, close social bonds between individuals provide considerable long-term health and fitness benefits, but are also expected to influence short-term behavioural decisions. We investigated whether social-bond strength (as determined from grooming interactions) influenced foraging decisions in cooperatively breeding dwarf mongoose groups. We found particularly strong social bonds in the form of preferred grooming partnerships in a subset of male-female dyads.

We analysed interactions between fallow deer, European roe deer and wild boar, in three sites, in a Mediterranean area. We expected that interference should be greater between deer than between them and wild boar. We documented the negative effects of behavioural interference by fallow on foraging behaviour of roe deer, under field conditions. Deer species built up 90% interference interactions, with fallow always dominant on roe, also through direct aggression. Although roe deer decreased feeding and increased vigilance levels in proximity (< 50 m) of either fallow deer or wild boar, they were displaced significantly more often by the former than by the latter. Fallow deer were neither displaced nor alarmed by roe and rarely by wild boar. No deer species displaced wild boar. Interference was significantly greater on solitary roe deer, especially females, in spring and roe left the feeding ground most often in the smallest site (13 ha). Roe deer avoided areas where the local density of fallow deer was the highest. During our 4-year-study, roe deer density decreased whereas fallow deer numbers increased. Behavioural interference may explain how fallow deer outcompete roe deer through spatial exclusion from feeding sites and avoidance of areas with high densities of the former.

However, previous studies have shown that herbivores are able to reduce the foraging cost of vigilance by chewing their food during vigilance bouts ('vigilance with chewing', as compared to 'vigilance without chewing'). How predation risk, food availability and competition affect both the functions and the foraging costs of vigilance remains an open question. We studied female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, during winter and summer, when available food supplies were poor and rich, respectively, to investigate how group size, distance to cover, proximity between foragers and food patch quality affected decisions of foraging female kangaroos to exhibit antipredator or social vigilance, distinguishing vigilance with and without chewing. The use of antipredator vigilance was mainly driven by the perception of predation risk, and antipredator vigilance without chewing decreased with increased group size whereas antipredator vigilance with chewing increased nonlinearly with group size in winter. Distance to cover affected both forms of antipredator vigilance in summer only but there was no effect of nearest-neighbour distance. Social vigilance was affected positively by group size, and distance between foragers affected social vigilance without chewing positively, particularly in winter, and social vigilance with chewing negatively. Finally, patch quality increased the use of social vigilance with chewing in both seasons and decreased the use of antipredator vigilance with chewing in winter. This study provides new information on how animals make decisions about the functions and foraging costs of vigilance and allows a better understanding of how social foragers respond to an ever-changing environment.

Affiliative interactions are associated with benefits and strengthen social bonds, while aggressive interactions are costly and negatively affect social bonds. Individuals may attempt to reduce aggressive encounters through submissive displays directed at higher-ranking individuals. Thus, fine-scale patterns of affilia-tive, aggressive, and submissive interactions may reflect costly and beneficial social relationships within groups, providing insight into the benefits of group living and the mechanisms of conflict resolution. So far, however, most studies have looked at social interactions and benefits of group living in isolation. We investigated how the strength of social bonds (affiliative vs. aggressive interactions) and submissive displays varied with kin-selected and potential mating benefits, and with reproductive conflict in the cooperatively breeding purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus. Our results revealed that subordinates formed equally strong social bonds with kin and potential mates (unrelated opposite-sex individuals) while they formed antagonistic relationships with reproductive competitors that offered no kin-selected or mating benefits (unrelated same-sex individuals). Submissive displays were directed exclusively at same-sex breeders, regardless of relatedness. Affiliation and submission were associated with reduced foraging time when food was limited, indicating a cost to maintaining positive relationships. Together, our results suggest that the strength of social bonds is determined by (potential) benefits obtained from group members, while submission likely serves to reduce conflict.

Specifically, primates have been reported to use mostly topological and rarely Euclidean maps when navigating in large-scale space. Here, we aimed to investigate if the navigation of wild common marmosets inhabiting a semiarid environment is consistent with a topological representation and how environmental factors affect navigation. We collected 497 h of direct behavioral and GPS information on a group of marmosets using a 2-min instantaneous focal animal sampling technique. We found that our study group reused not only long-route segments (mean of 1007 m) but entire daily routes, a pattern that is not commonly seen in primates. The most frequently reused route segments were the ones closer to feeding sites, distant to resting sites, and in areas sparse in tree vegetation. We also identified a total of 56 clustered direction change points indicating that the group modified their direction of travel. These changes in direction were influenced by their close proximity to resting and feeding sites. Despite our small sample size, the obtained results are important and consistent with the contention that common marmosets navigate using a topological map that seems to benefit these animals in response to the exploitation of clustered exudate trees. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the Caatinga landscape imposes physical restrictions in our group's navigation such as gaps in vegetation, small trees and xerophytic plants.

In the Old World, birds often form conspecific foraging groups that are maintained year-round and offspring usually disperse to other social groups. We tested the hypothesis that nonbreeding group members are largely unrelated and gain direct fitness benefits through breeding opportunities (males) and brood parasitism (females) in the tropical gray-throated babbler, Stachyris nigriceps, in Malaysian Borneo. Babblers foraged in social groups containing one or more breeding pairs (median = 8 group members of equal sex ratio), but group members rarely assisted with breeding (9% of 67 breeding pairs had a third helper; exhibiting facultative cooperative breeding). Although 20% of 266 group member dyads were first-order relatives of one or both members of the breeding pairs, 80% were unrelated. Male group members gained direct fitness benefits through extrapair and extra-group paternity (25% of 73 offspring), which was independent of their relatedness to the breeding pair and increased with decreasing group size. In contrast, females did not gain direct fitness benefits through brood parasitism. The low levels of relatedness and helping in social groups suggest that most group members do not gain indirect fitness benefits by helping to raise unrelated offspring.

Sato_2013,"Sato, Hiroki",Habitat shifting by the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus): a response to food scarcity,PRIMATES,"During periods of food scarcity, most primates display behavioral responses, such as dietary switching or adjustment of traveling and foraging efforts, within home ranges. In rare cases, several primate species leave their home ranges for other remote habitats to seek alternative resources; this migration-like behavior is termed habitat shifting. Reports of habitat shifting have concentrated on platyrrhines, but this behavior has rarely been observed among prosimians. During 1 year of observation of a troop of common brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) in Ankarafantsika National Park, northwestern Madagascar, habitat shifting occurred twice. To understand the causes of this behavior, I examined the seasonal availability of fruit resources in the range continuously used by the troop during the year (defined as the annual range) and compared feeding activities and vegetation types between the annual range and new areas. The troop usually stayed within a 38.7-ha annual range, defined by a 95 % fixed kernel analysis based on GPS location data collected at 5-min intervals. In April 2007, the lemurs suddenly moved to a habitat 1.0-1.5 km south of their annual range and concentrated on the consumption of Grewia triflora fruits for 2 weeks. In November 2007, they visited a habitat 0.8-1.7 km southeast of the annual range and exploited fruits of Landolphia myrtifolia. These new areas were open habitats with high densities of the respective fruit species. The density of fruiting trees was low in the annual range during these periods; thus, habitat shifting to areas with different phenological productivity appeared to be an effective response to fruit scarcity. Brown lemurs are generally categorized as a nonterritorial species, and the lemurs observed here showed no agonistic behavior in intergroup encounters during range shifting. Such nonterritoriality may allow brown lemurs to shift habitats, a behavior resulting in long-term absence from their annual range.",2013,10.1007/s10329-013-0353-7,yes,ethology_remote,obs,Eulemur_fulvus,primate,mammal,"direct_obs, ethogram",12,0.387,0.070138889,,101,AB,yes,ethogram,"social, group_movement","watched for 101 obs. days during 1 calendar year, which to use as temporal range??",

We therefore experimentally studied interference in the wild, capitalizing on 2 cockle beds in an isolated bay that were exploited by a population of individually marked oystercatchers. We successfully increased forager density by chasing birds from one cockle bed, leaving the other cockle bed as the only nearby alternative. The density increase was most pronounced on the eastern cockle bed where food stocks were poorer and initial feeding densities were lower compared with the western cockle bed. Oystercatchers residing on this eastern bed suffered a significant decline in intake rate when bird density was experimentally increased, providing evidence of interference. Refugee birds, that is, the birds that were displaced from their home bed, experienced an even stronger reduction in intake rate compared with the residents and compared with their intake rate on their home bed, probably partly due to the fact that the refugee birds were forced to feed on an unfamiliar cockle bed. The fact that disturbance at 1 site influenced both the refugees and the local resident birds indicates that human disturbance (an important conservation issue) has an effect that extends beyond the site where the disturbance takes place.

van_der_Marel_2019,"van der Marel, Annemarie; Lopez-Darias, Marta; Waterman, Jane M.",Group-enhanced predator detection and quality of vigilance in a social ground squirrel,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Animals may form groups for different reasons, and one major benefit of grouping in many species is reduced predation risk. In diurnal species, vigilance is used to detect predators, resulting in a trade-off between feeding activity and predation risk. Species can reduce the cost of this trade-off with low-quality vigilance - performing another behaviour while vigilant - in comparison to high-quality vigilance (only being vigilant). Two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining an inverse relationship between individual vigilance and group size are the dilution effect, where predation risk decreases in larger groups, and collective detection, where larger groups have more individuals that may detect a predator. Two predictions that support collective detection but not the dilution effect are that (1) overall group (collective) vigilance will increase with increasing group size, even while individual vigilance decreases, and (2) at least one group member must be vigilant to detect potential danger and communicate that information to group members. To test these predictions, we recorded behavioural data on low- and high-quality vigilance and alarm calling in the gregarious Barbary ground squirrel, Atlantoxerus getulus. Barbary ground squirrels allocated more time to high-quality vigilance than lowquality vigilance. The collective detection hypothesis was partly supported: as group size increased, individual low- and high-quality vigilance did not decrease, but collective high-quality vigilance did increase. Furthermore, we found that repetitive alarm calling warned group members of terrestrial threats. Our results show that this invasive species displays specific antipredator behaviours to different aerial and terrestrial predators compared to predators in their endemic range. The low level of time allocated to low-quality vigilance indicates that natural selection strongly favours high-quality vigilance in this species despite the trade-off with foraging. Our study broadens our understanding of antipredator and risk-sensitive behaviour.

However, how does it work in species that do not produce such signals? We investigated how detection of a threat occurred in groups of kangaroos. We showed that detectors, through their vigilant posture, provided information about the threat to other close group members and reactions proceeded sequentially like a domino effect. Collective detection thus appears not to be restricted to social species that exhibit conspicuous alarm signals.Although collective detection plays a key role in determining individual survival, few studies have carefully examined the collective process of detection. We investigated collective detection in the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), a species that forages in temporary groups and rarely produces auditory alarm signals on detection. In experimental trials, we exposed one group member to a predation threat (a python, Morelia spilota) that its companions could only detect indirectly by observing the reaction of the detector. We videotaped these and control trials in which individuals were not exposed to the python and focal females simply used vigilance routinely. Our aims were to 1) examine whether collective detection occurred and, if so, 2) investigate the temporal pattern of the information transfer among individuals. The latencies between the focal females first scans and those of their 4 neighbors were shorter in the exposed than those in the control groups. The latencies between successive individuals scans were on average shorter in the exposed groups and at the beginning of the reaction chain, and interindividual distances acted to constrain information transfer. More individuals became vigilant in the exposed than in the control groups. Thus, detection of the snake by focal females provided information about a potential threat to other close group members and reactions to this initial detection proceeded sequentially like a domino effect.

Here, we investigate the relationship between food resources, feeding competition, energy intake and reproduction in a group of wild female Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) in northeastern Thailand. Over 2,100 h of data on feeding behaviour, energy intake and activity budgets were combined with data on resource characteristics, female reproduction and physical condition. We found that an increase in food availability had a positive effect on female energy intake and conception rates. In addition, it appeared that females incurred energetic costs during lactation and that females with a better physical condition during the mating season were more likely to conceive. The annual birth season occurred a few months before the annual peak in food availability, causing peak lactation to coincide with a period of high food availability. This suggests that females use the increased food abundance to compensate for the energetic costs of lactation. Neither energy intake rates nor activity budgets were influenced by female dominance rank, even during periods when the levels of contest competition were predicted to be high. In line with this, we found no evidence for rank-related differences in reproduction. The apparently limited influence of feeding competition in female Assamese macaques adds to the debate on the extent to which patterns in feeding competition and fitness can reliably be predicted based on ecological conditions.

Previous studies on group-living primates have focused on the relationship between feeding-group size and feeding rate in food patches, and have exhibited inconsistent results, showing positive, neutral, or negative relationships. The relationship realized will depend on the balance of positive and negative impacts of co-feeding on feeding rate. The intensity of negative impacts (i.e., feeding competition) may vary with some characteristics of food items such as (1) patch size, (2) within-patch food density, (3) within-patch distribution pattern of food, (4) the abundance and (5) distribution pattern of within-habitat food trees, and (6) the relative energy content among available food items. Thus, the balance of positive and negative impacts of co-feeding, and ultimately the relationship between feeding-group size and feeding rate, is expected to change with characteristics of food items. In this study of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), the relationship between feeding-group size and feeding rate, and the above six characteristics of 12 main food items were assessed over six seasons. Positive, neutral, or negative relationships between feeding-group size and feeding rate were detected among these food items.

Using 2,707 observations of muzzle contact occurring across 3 troops of wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), we tested this social learning hypothesis. We first explored the social structuring of muzzle contact by analyzing the characteristics of initiators and receivers. Similar to previous research, juveniles initiated contact at higher rates than adults, particularly toward adult females and animals with lower dominance rankings. The highest number of contacts occurred between kin compared to contacts between nonkin. However, on the whole, contacts occurred at low rates, even among kin dyads. We next determined whether muzzle contact was used as a means to learn socially, specifically by animals seeking foraging information. We found that initiators did not overwhelmingly target foragers, meaning animals do not appear to directly seek information about food during muzzle contact. However, animals that contacted foragers were more likely forage themselves in comparison to those that contacted non-foragers, suggesting that foragers do provide food information. These findings indicate that both kin and low-ranking animals serve as discriminative stimuli for social tolerance and that foraging animals serve as discriminative stimuli for food availability.

However, as vigilance is used for both predator detection and obtaining social information, individuals must decide how to divide their time between these two vigilance types. Yet, it is unclear (1) how prey species living in the centre and edge of groups prioritize their use of these different vigilance types and (2) how this prioritization varies with increasing risk. To explore this, we focused on the degree to which impala, Aepyceros melampus, a herd-living antelope, adjusted their antipredator (looking out from the herd) and social (looking at herd members) vigilance across three sites with different predator guilds and predator densities. We found that as predator types and densities increased, herd size increased, but that impala did not adjust the total time they spent vigilant (antipredator plus social vigilance). Thus, they did not sacrifice other fitness-enhancing activities (e.g. foraging) to increase vigilance. Yet, overall, within the herds, edge individuals displayed greater total vigilance (antipredator plus social) and showed a greater proportional use of antipredator vigilance compared to central individuals. With increasing predator numbers, edge individuals maintained and ultimately increased their proportional use of antipredator vigilance. In contrast, central individuals reduced their use of antipredator vigilance and increased social vigilance. As suggested elsewhere, this adjustment might have been related to these individuals trying to increase foraging efficiency and cohesion benefits. However, they may have also monitored conspecifics to detect threats, while obtaining both short(e.g. less time spent in a vulnerable head-down position) and long-term (e.g. reduced daily foraging time allowing more time for less vulnerable activities) anti predator benefits. Ultimately, our results highlight that herd position and predator differences can influence overall vigilance levels and how individuals adjust their use of antipredator and social vigilance.

Schmitt_2014,"Schmitt, Melissa H.; Stears, Keenan; Wilmers, Christopher C.; Shrader, Adrian M.",Determining the relative importance of dilution and detection for zebra foraging in mixed-species herds,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"For many animals, a key benefit of group living is lowered predation risk. With increasing group size, individuals commonly reduce vigilance. This group size effect can arise from both dilution of risk and increased collective detection. To determine which was more important, we compared vigilance levels of plains zebra, Equus quagga, in areas inhabited by their main predator, lion, Panthera leo, as a function of herd size and composition (zebra-only versus mixed-species herds). For zebra-only herds, vigilance declined with increasing zebra numbers. In contrast, in mixed-species herds, zebra vigilance levels were significantly lower and did not vary with the total number of ungulates and/or zebra in the herd. This lower vigilance can be explained by detection benefits, since we controlled for the influence of herd size (i.e. dilution) statistically. Furthermore, we found that zebra in smaller herds were half as vigilant when they co-occurred with another preferred prey of lion, blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, compared with zebra-only herds. However, when zebra foraged with impala, Aepyceros melampus, a nonpreferred prey, there was only a slight reduction in vigilance compared with similar-sized zebra-only herds. Interestingly, the decrease in zebra vigilance when herding with wildebeest was influenced by the presence/absence, but not number, of wildebeest. In contrast, impala only reduced zebra vigilance when they comprised about 75% of the herd. Ultimately, our results indicate that for zebra in mixed-species herds, detection benefits are relatively more important than dilution over a larger range of herd sizes. However, detection only reduces vigilance when zebras herd with species that share a common predator (i.e. diluting partner). Potentially, detection by species that do not share a common predator (i.e. low-diluting partner) is not as reliable as detection by diluting species.

Avian flocks have traditionally been classified as monolithic species units, with species-wide functional roles, such as nuclear, active, passive, or follower. It has also been suggested that flocks are mutualistic interactions, where niches of participating species converge. However the species-level perspective has limited previous studies, because both interactions and benefits occur at the level of the individual. Social network analysis provides a set of tools for quantitative assessment of individual participation. We used mark-resighting methods to develop networks of nodes (colour-marked individuals) and edges (their interactions within flocks). We found that variation in flock participation across individuals within species, especially in the buff-rumped thornbill, encompassed virtually the entire range of variation across all individuals in the entire set of species. For example, female, but not male, buff-rumped thornbills had high network betweenness, indicating that they interact with multiple flocks, likely as part of a female-specific dispersal strategy. Finally, we provide new evidence that mixed-species flocking is mutualistic, by quantifying an active shift in individual foraging niches towards those of their individual associates, with implications for trade-off between costs and benefits to individuals derived from participating in mixed-species flocks.

J.","Environmental variability, the value of information, and learning in winter residents",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Cognitive processes related to the collection, storage and use of information (e.g. learning, memory) contribute to reducing uncertainty about the environment and can thus be key to survival and reproduction. However, information processing is rarely cost-free, and thus cognitive adaptations are expected to be fined-tuned to prevailing ecological and social conditions. Models and laboratory experiments underline the importance of environmental variability in determining the value of information; however, we still know very little on the link between environmental variability and cognitive abilities in wild populations. Here we outline a series of studies in which we assessed information use and learning in conspecifics living along two ecological gradients that impact variability of the food supply: elevation and urbanization. While low- and high-elevation great tits, Parus major, were found to differ in accuracy in a reversal learning task, the difference was in the direction opposite to our prediction, with low-elevation birds outperforming their high-elevation counterparts. Furthermore, we found no relationship between urbanization and spatial memory accuracy in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, despite urban habitats being known to harbour more stable food supplies during the winter and, thus, potentially providing lower incentive to invest in food hoarding and spatial memory. However, as predicted, chickadees in urban habitats explored a new environment faster and seemed to rely less heavily on social information about novel food patches compared to forest chickadees. Our results point to the need to better link predictive models with experienced fluctuations in food availability for individual foragers and to take into account social as well as ecological variables that can impact the value of information and may covary along natural gradients of harshness.

We video recorded a total of 600 actively foraging birds at the intertidal mudflats of the lagoon during the wintering period. We collected data on capturing rates, foraging method and movement characteristics for each observed individual. Results highlighted that studied shorebird species showed marked differences in their feeding strategies and movements when foraging. Plovers used exclusively a visual-run-stop strategy (superficial pecks), unlike Scolopacidae species that showed a wider range of types of feeding behaviour. Generally, this group favoured a tactile-continuous hunting strategy and it can be divided into two important subgroups. The first, including calidrids and shanks, used a mixed hunting strategy (pecking and probing) and had the highest prey capture rate and the fastest feeding rhythm, whereas the second included larger shorebirds that predominantly used tactile foraging technique with a slower rhythm and straighter trajectory. These differences in foraging behaviour and strategies suggest that shorebird species are able to exploit the intertidal flats and trophic resources of Merja Zerga in different ways, a fact that ensures that this site can host large numbers of birds at the same time, because of a lower level of interspecific competition.",2020,10.2989/00306525.2020.1774439,yes,audio video,obs,shorebird_spp.,shorebird,bird,"direct_video, ethogram",600,30,0.001041667,,120,AB,no,movement,"social, migratory_stopover","did not ID indivs, 600obs across 15 species, ""winter 2014-15"" is the study period, assuming 4 mo?",

Here, we examined goal-directed travel towards locations where biologically meaningful events had previously taken place to elucidate the relative importance of past social and ecological information for route planning. We inferred goal-directed travelling by detecting long sections of straight-line travel, followed by significant directional changes along travel trajectories of five neighbouring groups of black howler monkeys, Alouatta pigra, at Palenque National Park, Mexico. Post hoc, we determined at the approached locations: (1) the behaviour of the group; (2) the occurrence of previous intergroup interactions; and (3) the ecological properties of the feeding tree (i.e. importance in diet, level of phenological synchrony). The likelihood of goal-directed travel towards a location to engage in loud calling increased after having experienced an encounter with a neighbouring group at that same location in the past. Additionally, the likelihood of goal-directed travel towards a location to forage on fruits increased when the approached tree was considered important in the diet with highly synchronous phenological cycles. Our results indicate that route planning in wild animals involves an integration of both social and ecological variables. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Eastern grey kangaroos Macropus giganteus are gregarious and live in fission-fusion societies where adult females do not form strong bonds with other females but associate closely with their juvenile offspring. We aimed to determine whether the strength of these mother-offspring associations correlated with offspring size, survival and reproduction. We observed 129 marked offspring, aged 10 to 21 months, and their mothers in a high-density population at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Australia. We used half-weight indices to quantify mother-offspring associations and determined the proportion of time offspring spent with their mother, but isolated from other kangaroos, while foraging. We found strong cohort effects on size, mass, body condition, survival and reproduction. Mother-offspring sociability indices were not correlated with offspring body condition as 2-year-olds or reproduction as 3-year-olds. Juveniles that spent proportionally more time with their mothers at 18-21 months, however, were 6% larger and 19% heavier as 2-year-olds than those that did not associate closely with their mothers. In addition, juveniles that were often found alone with their mothers were more likely to survive than those that were more often found in larger groups. Stronger mother-offspring associations before weaning likely reflected nutritional maternal care in sons but non-nutritional care in daughters and had a beneficial effect on juvenile growth and survival. Significance statement The possible fitness consequences of mother-offspring behavioural associations can affect reproductive decisions by mothers. These fitness consequences affect population dynamics and are relevant to conservation when mothers may be harvested or killed by vehicles, as is the case for many large herbivores. We show that variability in these associations in kangaroos affects correlates of offspring fitness. Juveniles that spent proportionally more time with their mothers between 18 and 21 months of age were larger and heavier as 2-year-olds. In addition, juveniles that spent proportionally more time with their mothers but isolated from other kangaroos experienced improved survival. This study is among very few to examine the relationship between mother-offspring sociability and reproductive success in a non-primate mammal.

To overcome these challenges. young animals are predicted to rely on adult relatives to gain foraging competency, partly because kin are more likely to tolerate the proximity of immatures, upon which socially facilitated learning of food selection and foraging skills depends. While evidence suggests that mothers improve the foraging success of their offspring, little is known about the potential contribution of fathers to the development of feeding skills. Here, we investigate the influence of both mothers and fathers on the foraging behaviour of young olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Laikipia. Kenya. Behavioural data were gathered via focal animal sampling and genetic relatedness was determined by microsateilite genotyping of non-invasively collected faecal DNA samples. We also conducted analyses to assess the nutritional and energetic content of staple foods consumed by the baboons. We found that, compared to when feeding near unrelated adults or alone, immatures were more likely to consume high energy foods when they were near their mothers and preliminary results suggest access to similar effects when near fathers.

In this study, we evaluate factors affecting postfledging family space use in a small territorial songbird, the great tit (Parus major). Family space use was monitored using radio tracking. Our main objectives were 1) to quantify in detail the temporal and spatial scale of family movements, 2) to test behavioral hypotheses explaining when and how frequently families leave their breeding territory, and 3) to test to what extent movements were based on familiarity with the environment. We found that variation in space use was to a large extent due to some families, but not others, regularly undertaking foraging excursions of up to more than a kilometer away. Daily excursion probability was higher for families occupying low-quality territories, and consequently, these families covered larger areas during foraging. Excursion behavior and range use also strongly depended on maternal breeding experience and personality. We further present some striking examples of inexperienced mothers moving toward previously visited areas, suggesting that familiarity with the environment plays an important role in patterns of space use.

Despite the fact that this period of care can last up to several months, it remains a relatively understudied stage of chick development. This period, when young are actively begging but highly mobile, provides an opportunity for young to maximise the amount of care they receive by selectively choosing particular adults to beg from. In pied babblers Turdoides bicolor (a cooperatively breeding passerine), fledglings closely follow foraging adults and beg for food regularly (a behavioural interaction termed social foraging). Using a combination of natural observations and experimental manipulations, we found that fledgling pied babblers preferentially socially forage with adult care-givers who have high foraging success, since this results in young receiving more food. By supplementally feeding adults to artificially increase their foraging success, we increased the proportion of time that fledglings chose to socially forage with them, confirming that fledglings are selectively choosing dyadic interactions with the best adult foragers.

Finally, we evaluated whether temporal distributions of scanning were significantly lower (coordination) or higher (synchrony) than random expectations using bootstrapping. We found that pairwise relatedness between focal degus and their foraging partner did not influence the scan effort or the temporal distribution of scanning.

Understanding how these species are adapting in non-native areas will elucidate evolutionary aspects of migration and adaptation skills of exotic species in general. Thus, we investigated how Amazonian squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) have adjusted their behavioural ecology and call propagation in an Atlantic forest fragment in north-eastern Brazil. Behavioural ecology data were obtained via instantaneous scan and ad libitum sampling methods. Call propagation data were obtained through playback experiments conducted in the Atlantic and Amazon forests. Atlantic forest squirrel monkey diet was found to be composed, primarily, of fruits considered exotic to the region. There was no variation between dry and wet months in food-resource exploitation except for flowers. Squirrel monkeys spent most of their time engaged in locomotion and foraging activities and had a preference for the Atlantic forest mid-strata. Nevertheless, resting, locomotion and social activities were most frequently demonstrated in the dry months, whereas foraging behaviours were mostly performed in the wet months. We found no variation between dry and wet months in the vertical use of the stratum, daily path length or home range size. The propagation of squirrel monkey isolation calls was more efficient in the Amazon compared with the Atlantic forest, with call acoustic parameters degrading faster in the Atlantic forest. Our results indicate that exotic squirrel monkeys have adjusted their activity pattern and diet in the Atlantic forest, resulting in behavioural variations consistent with the existing resources.

Species with a smaller size dimorphism are probably understudied, because the assumption is that aggregation rather than sex segregation should be the norm. We used 6 years of direct observations of goitered gazelles, Gazella subgutturosa, an ungulate with a small degree of sexual size dimorphism, to explore sexual segregation and aggregation patterns and habitat choice at two timescales. We predicted minimal differences in activity budgets between the sexes, based on their small size dimorphism, and did not expect any evolutionary niche divergence based on size. However, we found that goitered gazelles showed considerable sexual and habitat segregation for most of the year, and only showed a tendency to randomly aggregate during the peak of the rutting season. We also found that they segregated socially and by habitat and had different activity budgets in some months. Behavioural asynchrony and sexual differences in habitat use were much greater than predicted for a species with such a small sexual dimorphism in body size. Our study confirms strong multifactorial sexual segregation patterns, and points to the potential importance that social factors (aggression and territoriality) may have on sexual segregation in goitered gazelles.

Among placental mammals, trichromatic vision is unique to primates and is argued to be adaptive for foraging on reddish food. However, trichromacy is variably present in lemurs, including species within the cathemeral genus Eulemur, due to inter- and intra-specific variation in X-linked opsin genes. Although this variation could result from genetic drift, it could also reflect ecological adaptation. To understand ecological contributions to color vision variation, we examined cone opsin genes of 11 Eulemur species. We found that only E. flavifrons and E. macaco have polymorphic trichromacy. Most dichromatic species have an M (green-shifted) opsin; uniquely, one species (E. rubriventer) has dichromacy based on an L (red-shifted) opsin. This latter result appears to represent loss of polymorphic trichromacy from a dichromatic (M opsin) or polymorphic Eulemur ancestor. To address potential ecological explanations for opsin variation, we studied the dietary behavior of wild E. rubriventer and collected reflectance spectra from plant species consumed. Visual models suggest that trichromacy should provide an advantage for detecting reddish foods; however, luminance contrasts were greatest for dichromats with the L opsin. As E. rubriventer are often active in low-light rainforest conditions, luminance cues may be relatively important, which could favor the L opsin, while also leading to relaxed selection on, or selection against, trichromacy. The presence of different opsin alleles across Eulemur species could represent adaptations related to diet, activity pattern, or habitat.Significance statementLoss of genetic variation, often thought to be maladaptive, can occur through natural selection. Among primates, some species have trichromatic color vision, the ability to distinguish reddish and greenish hues; others are red-green colorblind (dichromatic). We examined adaptive explanations for color vision differences by studying cone opsin genes and behavior in wild lemurs (Eulemur)a genus that is active both day and night. We found that color vision is variable in Eulemur species, and full trichromatic vision was likely lost in at least one lineage. Foraging ecology of dichromatic Eulemur rubriventer indicates that trichromatic vision should be advantageous for foraging on reddish foods, but brightness cues are more salient to this species' vision. We suggest brightness may be more important than color to this species, particularly at night, and loss of trichromacy could be adaptive in some lemurs.",2019,10.1007/s00265-018-2629-9,yes,ethology,obs,Eulemur_rubriventer,primate,mammal,direct_obs,9,410,,2924,225,AB,no,movement,"social, targeted_follow","n = groups; 410km2 is the entire study area, no idea how mucharea they covered",

We studied the Eurasian wild sheep in trans-Himalayan rangelands to identify these causes and estimate the contributions of habitat and social components to sexual segregation. We observed male, lactating, and nonlactating female groups feeding during 3 springs and summers. The 3 groups strongly segregated and differed in their activity budgets, partly because of antipredation risks, with lactating females being the most vigilant (40% of the time). At the feeding habitat scale, males selected the patches of highest quality. We found that the social component contributed the most to segregation (70%) as compared with habitat segregation (30%). This is the first study that quantifies the contribution of habitat and social components to sexual segregation.

Roads have facilitated the economic and social development of human populations. Nevertheless their presence and human use cause environmental changes, such as clearing, which increase perception of predation risk. Among the responses to this are changes in animal behaviours. In the present study, we sought to assess whether roads in an Argentine reserve affect perception of predation risk by guanacos, Lama guanicoe, through behaviour changes. We analysed the effects of two types of roads (unpaved track and paved route) and their surrounding environment (e.g. vegetation structure) on group size variation and on three behaviours: vigilance, foraging and movement. We also used the group structure of guanacos, such as the number of calves, to explain these behaviours. Roads in the protected area had no impact on the size of guanaco groups. However, individuals in larger groups were less vigilant and foraged more closely to roads, indicating that closeness to roads is less risky for these animals. Although guanacos' time spent moving was not affected by roads, nearness to the unpaved track and high plant cover showed the highest proportions of animals moving in the area, and individuals moved more when in small groups and in areas with medium-height vegetation. The number of individuals displaying vigilance or foraging behaviours was not affected by any of the explanatory variables. Based on these findings, we conclude that guanacos perceive the roadside environment as safer, possibly because open areas adjacent to roads facilitate detection of predators. Knowing the effects of roads on wildlife in protected areas is necessary to find ways to reach a balance between the economic development of a region and conservation of its biodiversity.

King_2016,"King, Wendy J.; Goldizen, Anne W.",Few sex effects in the ontogeny of mother-offspring relationships in eastern grey kangaroos,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Social relationships established early in life can have effects on social structure and influence individual fitness. Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, nurse their young for at least 18 months, allowing for a strong bond to develop between mothers and young. Because most female kangaroos are philopatric, the mother-offspring relationship established during lactation could persist into adulthood, resulting in clusters of female kin. Strong social bonds, however, are based on affiliative behaviours and frequent interactions. In particular, one might not expect strong bonds among related individuals unless there are advantages to interacting with relatives compared to associating with unrelated conspecifics. We examined development of the mother-offspring relationship in eastern grey kangaroos from permanent emergence from the pouch to the time of weaning. We studied a high-density population at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Victoria, Australia. There were few differences in the behaviour of sons and daughters towards mothers. However, daughters foraged slightly closer than sons to their mothers and daughters were weaned approximately 2 months later than sons if the mother did not have a surviving large pouch young. Mothers associated more closely with their daughters than their sons when offspring were aged 10-29 months but neither sex associated closely with their mothers beyond 33 months of age. Mothers never intervened to defend their young from aggressive individuals and it was the offspring that maintained spatial proximity to their mothers. Kangaroo mothers had few interactions with their juvenile offspring other than nursing. Females may be philopatric and settle near close kin as adults but kangaroos appear to have few of those early affiliative interactions necessary for social bonds to develop.

Muller_2018,"Muller, Zoe; Cantor, Mauricio; Cuthill, Innes C.; Harris, Stephen",Giraffe social preferences are context dependent,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"The dynamic nature of animal societies often hides multiple layers of complexity. The field of animal behaviour is rapidly advancing with the development of increasingly sophisticated analytical methods that allow scientists to identify complex and nuanced drivers of social patterns. The resurgent interest in giraffe sociality illustrates this by challenging the early view that individuals interact at random; it became clear that, instead, giraffes can be organized into multilevel societies, apparently founded on preferred associations. However, it is unclear whether such enduring associations result from active choice for specific individuals. The extent to which other social and asocial factors can contribute to an individual's inclusion in groups remains underexplored. Here we assess how context affects social preferences at the individual level by evaluating grouping patterns of giraffes in different behavioural states, habitats and levels of disturbance. When we controlled for potential class-based (as opposed to individual-based) assortment of individuals by sex, age and gregariousness, we found that giraffes only exhibited individual social preferences when foraging, with minor influence of habitat complexity or level of disturbance. Our results indicate that behavioural context is a major driver of giraffe social association. This strengthens recent evidence of complex social systems in giraffes and suggests that classic metrics of social relationships (such as association indices) may be too coarse, concealing true social preferences in wild populations.

We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We have evaluated the effects of pasture quality on suckling behaviour and winter survival of Apennine chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata kids, across three areas. Areas A-B ('poor' areas) were characterised by a reduced availability of nutritious forage, thus a lower diet quality for female chamois and kids; Area C (a 'rich' area) included a much greater availability of nutritious forage. In poor areas, pasture quality has been reduced by climatic and plant composition changes, as well as the presence of a herbivore competitor (red deer Cervus elaphus). In poor areas, we recorded a significantly (1) lower suckling success of chamois kids (number of suckling bouts/number of suck attempts); (2) lower frequency of suckling bouts (n. suckling bouts/kid/h); and (3) lower suckling intensity (suck duration/kid/h) in respect to the rich area.

The proliferation of non-native annual grasses has increased wildfire frequency and extent in recent decades and continues to accelerate the conversion of tortoise habitat across the Mojave Desert. Immediate changes to vegetation are expected to reduce quality of critical habitat, yet whether tortoises will use burned and recovering habitat differently from intact unburned habitat is unknown. We compared movement patterns, home-range size, behavior, microhabitat use, reproduction, and survival for adult desert tortoises located in, and adjacent to, burned habitat to understand how tortoises respond to recovering burned habitat. Approximately 45% of home ranges in the post-fire environment contained burned habitat, and numerous observations (n=12,223) corroborated tortoise use of both habitat types (52% unburned, 48% burned). Tortoises moved progressively deeper into burned habitat during the first 5 years following the fire, frequently foraging in burned habitats that had abundant annual plants, and returning to adjacent unburned habitat for cover provided by intact perennial vegetation. However, by years 6 and 7, the live cover of the short-lived herbaceous perennial desert globemallow (Sphaeralcea ambigua) that typically re-colonizes burned areas declined, resulting in a contraction of tortoise movements from the burned areas. Health and egg production were similar between burned and unburned areas indicating that tortoises were able to acquire necessary resources using both areas. This study documents that adult Mojave desert tortoises continue to use habitat burned once by wildfire. Thus, continued management of this burned habitat may contribute toward the recovery of the species in the face of many sources of habitat loss. Published 2015.

Ecologists often use mechanistic animal movement models to understand these links, but animal movement models rarely connect empirically with an understanding of how animals actually decide to move around in their environment. To better understand this relationship, we compared the travel behaviour of two sympatric mammal species that have broadly similar diets: brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella nigritus, and ring-tailed coatis, Nasua nasua. According to most mechanistic animal movement models, species that exploit the same resources should show similar movement patterns. Although the fruit component of coati and capuchin diets is very similar, coatis primarily feed on invertebrates in the leaf litter or soil, while capuchins forage on invertebrate prey in the forest canopy. We found that these two species showed markedly different movement patterns: while capuchins typically travelled between fruit trees in relatively straight lines, coatis had significantly more tortuous daily travel paths and frequently visited the same fruit trees more than once per day. These circular coati travel paths would not be predicted by most foraging models. We posit that these differences in coati and capuchin movement patterns are driven by differences in arboreal and terrestrial travel costs, exploitation of fallen fruits and shifts in foraging behaviour over the course of the day. Because these seemingly small differences between the two species lead to major differences in movement behaviour, we posit that animal movement models need to better incorporate (1) travel costs, (2) both directed travel and random food search and (3) realistic diet models that include resources with different nutrient compositions.

Therefore, survival and reproductive success depend not only on the ability to secure prey but also on minimizing foraging costs. African wild dogs often coexist with lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta); these competitors can seriously increase foraging costs by kleptoparasitism. In this study, we empirically and experimentally assessed the risk and costs of kleptoparasitism for African wild dogs inside Hwange National Park, where hyena densities are high, and outside the park, where hyena densities are lower. Lion densities within the study area have been fluctuating. The risk and costs of kleptoparasitism were determined by comparing direct observations during hunt follows of radio collared African wild dog packs and by the use of experimental call-ups with African wild dog sounds inside and outside Hwange National Park. The risk of kleptoparasitism was found to be significantly higher inside the park. The time it took lions and hyenas to get to the kill site during African wild dog hunts was longer outside the park allowing the dogs a longer carcass access time. The found differences in risk and costs of kleptoparasitism could contribute to African wild dog habitat choice for the buffer zone outside Hwange National Park.

In multi-predator environments prey ideally use antipredator responses that are effective against all predator species, although responses may only be effective against one predator and counterproductive for another. Multi-predator systems may also include introduced predators that the prey did not co-evolve with, so the prey may either fail to recognize their threat (level 1 naivet,), use ineffective responses (level 2 naivet,) or succumb to their superior hunting ability (level 3 naivet,). We analyzed microhabitat selection of an Australian marsupial (koomal, Trichosurus vulpecula hypoleucus) when faced with spatiotemporal differences in the activity/density levels of one native (chuditch, Dasyurus geoffroii) and two introduced predators (red fox, Vulpes vulpes; feral cat, Felis catus). From this, we inferred whether koomal recognized introduced predators as a threat, and whether they minimized predation risk by either staying close to trees and/or using open or dense microhabitats. Koomal remained close to escape trees regardless of the predator species present, or activity/density levels, suggesting koomal employ this behavior as a first line of defense. Koomal shifted to dense cover only under high risk scenarios (i.e., with multiple predator species present at high densities). When predation risk was low, koomal used open microhabitats, which likely provided benefits not associated with predator avoidance. Koomal did not exhibit level 1 naivet,, although further studies are required to determine if they exhibit higher levels of naivet, (2-3) against foxes and cats.",2013,10.1007/s00265-013-1561-2,yes,ethology,obs,Trichosurus_vulpecula,marsupial,mammal,thread_trailing,26,12,1,,1,C,yes,resting,"thread_tracking, predator_response, habitat_selection, microhabitat","only tracked for one night, but over a year... how to define time range",
Luncz_2018,"Luncz, Lydia V.; Sirianni, Giulia; Mundry, Roger; Boesch, Christophe",Costly culture: differences in nut-cracking efficiency between wild chimpanzee groups,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Cultural diversity among social groups has recently been documented in multiple animal species. Investigations of the origin and spread of diverse behaviour at group level in wild-ranging animals have added valuable information on social learning mechanisms under natural conditions. Behavioural diversity has been especially informative in the case of dispersal, where the transfer of individuals between groups leads to a sudden exposure to unfamiliar behaviour. Little is known, however, about the underlying costs and benefits of cultural transmission in animals and humans alike, as efficiency of cultural variants is often difficult to measure. The chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, of the Tai National Park in Ivory Coast are known to exhibit a number of cultural differences between social groups, including hammer selection for nut cracking. This provides the unique opportunity to quantify the efficiency of cultural variants. We compared foraging speed and number of hits applied during nut-cracking events between three neighbouring chimpanzee groups. Our results showed significant differences in nut-cracking efficiency, caused by hammer material selection and differences in the applied power of impact per nut. Persistent behavioural coherence within the respective groups implies that immigrants adjust their behaviour to local nut-cracking techniques, even when individual foraging success might be compromised. This suggests that the benefit of belonging to a social group might outweigh the benefits of maximizing individual foraging efficiency. The differences in nut-cracking efficiency between chimpanzee groups add to the ever-growing body of cultural variants in wild chimpanzees and expand our knowledge of the importance of group belonging and conformity in wild chimpanzees.

In this study, we investigated the selection of hammers used for cracking Coula nuts by wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, taking account of the availability of potential tools at the site and time of tool selection. Using GLMMs and focal follows of five adult females, we estimated the probability of an object being selected as a hammer according to its physical properties, transport distance and the location of the anvil on the ground or in trees. We found that chimpanzees took account of several variables at the same time (multidimensionality) when selecting nut- cracking tools and that their selection for hammer weight was adjusted to the state/value of other variables (conditionality). In particular, chimpanzees (1) preferred stones over wooden clubs and hard woods over soft woods; (2) selected heavy stones, but relatively lighter wooden hammers; (3) selected increasingly heavier hammers the closer they were to the anvil; and (4) selected lighter hammers when they were going to crack nuts on a tree. The latter two results represent instances of conditional tool selection based on the next steps in an operational sequence (transport and/or use of the tool in a stable or unstable location) and suggest that chimpanzees anticipated future events when they chose a tool. This large set of conditional rules suggests a high level of cognitive sophistication in a tool use task. Our results represent a compelling example of how powerful cognitive skills allow the optimization of an ecologically relevant foraging activity, supporting a food extraction hypothesis for the evolution of complex cognition in our closest relatives.

J.; Clarke, Michael F.",Interactions between the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae) and fire in south-eastern Australia,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Context. The superb lyrebird Menura novaehollandiae is thought to be an important ecosystem engineer that, through its foraging, accelerates the decomposition of litter in Eucalyptus forests. Lyrebird foraging is therefore likely to affect forest fuel loads and hence fire behaviour in these fire-prone forests. In turn, fire is likely to reduce the abundance and influence the distribution of lyrebirds. Aims. Our goal was to determine the impacts of a major bushfire on the habitat and food sources for the superb lyrebird and the effects of foraging activities of lyrebirds on litter fuel and potential fire behaviour in gullies of herb-rich foothill forests. Methods. The effect of fire on lyrebirds and their habitat in the post-fire environment was examined at the landscape-scale, 2 years after fire; and at the patch-scale, 3 years after fire. Paired exclusion and control plots were also used over a 9-month period to assess the effects of foraging by the lyrebird on litter accumulation and fuel connectivity. Fire-behaviour models were used to determine the potential influence of lyrebird scratchings on fire behaviour. Key results. At the landscape scale, lyrebirds were present in both unburnt and ground-burnt sites, but not in canopy-burnt sites. Within patchily burnt sites, lyrebirds favoured foraging in unburnt patches. On average, lyrebird foraging reduced litter fuel loads by25%(1.66 t ha(-1)) in plots in which they were free to forage, compared with plots from which they were excluded, over a 9-month period. Fire-behaviour modelling showed that lyrebird foraging led to a lower likelihood of fire occurring and less intense fire. Conclusions. Distinctly different vegetation structure and composition between burnt and unburnt patches appears to influence both the foraging patterns and distribution of lyrebirds. Additionally, foraging by lyrebirds reduces surface fuel loads and fuel connectivity such that fire spread is likely to be inhibited. Implications. We propose that alternative stable states may emerge in Eucalyptus forests as a result of feedback mechanisms among lyrebirds, vegetation and fuel accumulation. Therefore, the ecological role of lyrebirds is an important consideration in forest fuel management and conservation in these extensive, fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia.",2014,10.1071/WR14052,yes,tracking,obs,Menura_novaehollandiae,galliform,bird,"tracking, feeding_evidence",n/a,3.65,,,n/a,B,no,n/a,"tracking, feeding_evidence",looking for distinctive scratchmarks in the ground from this species,

However, the effects of these decisions are more pronounced in migratory birds because they spend more time and energy foraging than on the actual journey itself. The peak flowering and pollination period of crops in southern Israel, when large numbers of hives are transported to the region, coincide with the peak migration of Bee-eaters. We hypothesized that Bee-eaters cue on conspecifics while foraging at a stopover site, react to perceived danger at a given foraging patch, and that the degree of risk taken by an individual was a function of body condition and sex. Bee-eaters were caught on 44 different mornings in spring 2004, 2005, and 2009. A sex-dependent trapping was noted and significantly more females were caught in the first bout. The sex ratio remained significantly male biased in bouts 3-8. Birds caught in the first bout were heavier in comparison to those caught in the second bout, and there was a significant interaction between sex and bouts. From the second bout onwards both sexes showed a significant increase in body mass, by 1.05 g/bout on average (+/- 0.6 SD), however wing lengths remained similar for both sexes. We conclude that migrant Bee-eaters cue on conspecifics to evaluate predation risks when socially foraging at a localized food patch and males, who we assume to be time-minimizers, are more likely to forage at a novel site and once danger of foraging is perceived only high energy demand individuals will attempt to hunt.

It was recently proposed that the mole rats in this locality are undergoing sympatric ecological speciation. We predicted that mole rats from basaltic soil would be less active than those from rendzina as a result of the reduced need for burrowing to reach food. By contrast to our predictions, mole rats from basaltic soil were more frequently located outside the nest and observed pushing soil above ground. We suggest that this is a result of territorial behaviour due to high population density. All mole rats exhibited a unimodal daily activity pattern likely related to temperature. Large males had large but gradually decreasing home-ranges, likely indicating the end of the mating season.

When aggressive, physically dominant species are displaced by anthropogenic disturbance, physically weaker species exploit competitor and predator downtimes to forage in previously risky places. Birds feeding at outdoor restaurants and cafes in association with humans are exposed to fluctuating levels of perceived danger caused by frequently changing densities of human diners. Consequently, birds must make decisions about which dining tables to visit based on trade-offs between foraging gain and perceived danger from avian competitors and humans. We tested the hypothesis that interspecific differences in response to perceived danger, combined with varying densities of human diners, dynamically alter which bird species predominates at dining tables. We found that house sparrows (Passer domesticus) tolerated higher human diner-densities than larger-sized, more physically dominant Eurasian jackdaws (Coloeus monedula). Sparrows were usually the first birds to visit diner-occupied tables and spent more time there than jackdaws. However, at diner-abandoned tables, this pattern changed: During low diner-densities at surrounding tables, jackdaws were usually the predominant species in first visits and minutes spent visiting, while at high diner-densities sparrows usually predominated. Moreover, along a gradient of increasing human diner-density, sparrows gradually replaced jackdaws as the predominant species in first visits and time at abandoned tables. However, at diner-occupied tables, once a sparrow chose which table to visit, factors other than diner-density influenced its choice of where to forage there (table-top or ground).

An optimal tracking system should be lightweight, measure three-dimensional locations, enable flexible measurement schemes, transmit data remotely and measure environmental variables and biological parameters of the individual. Giving full consideration to the traits of birds and the constraints of technology, we have developed a GPS tracking system that attempts to achieve most of the aspirations of an optimal tracking system for free ranging birds without the need to recapture them. Here, we describe the design, performance and limitations of the system. We also present measurements on the tracked Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus to show how such a system can generate new opportunities for research at multiple scales. The GPS tracker weighs 12 g and includes a GPS receiver, micro-processor, 4 MB of memory for data storage, solar panel and battery. It has a tri-axial accelerometer to monitor behaviour. To maximize flexibility, it is equipped with a radio transceiver for bidirectional communication with a ground-based antenna network, which enables data to be downloaded and new measurement schemes to be uploaded remotely. The system facilitates a multi-scale approach to studying bird movement, from fine-scale movements (3-s measurement intervals) to long-distance migratory movements (intervals of 20-30 min) of the same individual.

However, inclusion of activity sensors in many GPS collars also grants the potential to remotely estimate behavioral state. Thus, only using GPS collars to collect location data belies their full capabilities. Coupling behavioral state with location data would allow researchers and managers to refine habitat selection models by using diel behavioral state changes to partition fine-scale temporal shifts in habitat selection. We tested the capability of relatively unsophisticated GPS-collar activity sensors to estimate behavior throughout diel periods using free-ranging female elk (Cervus canadensis) in the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico, USA, 2013-2014. Collars recorded cumulative number of movements (hits) per 15-min recording period immediately preceding GPS fixes at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 hr. We measured diel behavioral patterns of focal elk, categorizing active (i.e., foraging, traveling, vigilant, grooming) and inactive (i.e., resting) states. Active behaviors (foraging, traveling) produced more average hits (0.87 +/- 0.69 hits/min, 4.0 +/- 2.2 hits/min, respectively; 95% CI) and inactive (resting) behavior fewer hits (-1.1 +/- 0.61 95% CI). We differentiated active and inactive behavioral states with a bootstrapped threshold of 5.9 +/- 3.9 hits/15-min recording period. Mean cumulative activity-sensor hits corresponded with observed diel behavioral patterns: hits increased during crepuscular (0600, 1800 hr) observations when elk were most active (0000-0600 hr: d = 0.19; 1200-1800 hr: d = 0.64) and decreased during midday and night (0000 hr, 1200 hr) when elk were least active (1800-0000 hr: d = -0.39; 0600-1200 hr: d = -0.43).

A.",Are white storks addicted to junk food? Impacts of landfill use on the movement and behaviour of resident white storks (Ciconia ciconia) from a partially migratory population,MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,"Background: The migratory patterns of animals are changing in response to global environmental change with many species forming resident populations in areas where they were once migratory. The white stork (Ciconia ciconia) was wholly migratory in Europe but recently guaranteed, year-round food from landfill sites has facilitated the establishment of resident populations in Iberia. In this study 17 resident white storks were fitted with GPS/GSM data loggers (including accelerometer) and tracked for 9.1 +/- 3.7 months to quantify the extent and consistency of landfill attendance by individuals during the non-breeding and breeding seasons and to assess the influence of landfill use on daily distances travelled, percentage of GPS fixes spent foraging and non-landfill foraging ranges. Results: Resident white storks used landfill more during non-breeding (20.1 % +/- 2.3 of foraging GPS fixes) than during breeding (14.9 % +/- 2.2). Landfill attendance declined with increasing distance between nest and landfill in both seasons. During non-breeding a large percentage of GPS fixes occurred on the nest throughout the day (27 % +/- 3.0 of fixes) in the majority of tagged storks. This study provides first confirmation of year-round nest use by resident white storks. The percentage of GPS fixes on the nest was not influenced by the distance between nest and the landfill site. Storks travelled up to 48.2 km to visit landfills during non-breeding and a maximum of 28.1 km during breeding, notably further than previous estimates. Storks nesting close to landfill sites used landfill more and had smaller foraging ranges in non-landfill habitat indicating higher reliance on landfill. The majority of non-landfill foraging occurred around the nest and long distance trips were made specifically to visit landfill. Conclusions: The continuous availability of food resources on landfill has facilitated year-round nest use in white storks and is influencing their home ranges and movement behaviour. White storks rely on landfill sites for foraging especially during the non-breeding season when other food resources are scarcer and this artificial food supplementation probably facilitated the establishment of resident populations.

This offers opportunities to gain fine-scale insights into behaviour from individual-sensor as well as integrated multi-sensor data. In the context of behaviour recognition, even though accelerometers have been used extensively, magnetometers have recently been shown to detect specific behaviours that accelerometers miss. The prevalent constraint of limited training data necessitates the importance of identifying behaviours with high robustness to data from new individuals, and may require fusing data from both these sensors. However, no study yet has developed an end-to-end approach to recognise common animal behaviours such as foraging, locomotion, and resting from magnetometer data in a common classification framework capable of accommodating and comparing data from both sensors. Methods We address this by first leveraging magnetometers' similarity to accelerometers to develop biomechanical descriptors of movement: we use the static component given by sensor tilt with respect to Earth's local magnetic field to estimate posture, and the dynamic component given by change in sensor tilt with time to characterise movement intensity and periodicity. We use these descriptors within an existing hybrid scheme that combines biomechanics and machine learning to recognise behaviour. We showcase the utility of our method on triaxial magnetometer data collected on ten wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), with annotated video recordings of each individual serving as groundtruth. Finally, we compare our results with accelerometer-based behaviour recognition. Results The overall recognition accuracy of > 94% obtained with magnetometer data was found to be comparable to that achieved using accelerometer data. Interestingly, higher robustness to inter-individual variability in dynamic behaviour was achieved with the magnetometer, while the accelerometer was better at estimating posture. Conclusions Magnetometers were found to accurately identify common behaviours, and were particularly robust to dynamic behaviour recognition. The use of biomechanical considerations to summarise magnetometer data makes the hybrid scheme capable of accommodating data from either or both sensors within the same framework according to each sensor's strengths.

To date, most GPS location schedules have been set at regular intervals. If intervals are too long, they undersample the details of movement paths, and if too short, they oversample resting sites and deplete the unit's battery without providing new information. We address this problem by creating a dynamic GPS schedule that is linked to the activity level of the animal via an accelerometer onboard the tracking tag. We deployed traditional and accelerometer-informed GPS tags on northern tamanduas anteater (Tamandua mexicana) in tropical forest in the Republic of Panama (2009-2010), and on fisher (Martes pennanti) in temperate forest in New York, USA (2009-2011). These species are medium-sized forest-dwellers that frequently use tree cavities, ground burrows, and thick vegetation for resting and foraging, all traits that make them particularly challenging for GPS tracking. The accelerometer-informed tags performed better than the traditional GPS tags: they attempted 73.6% more locations per day, achieved 61.7% higher location success rates, spent 28.2% less time searching for satellites, made 67.4% fewer redundant location attempts in places where animals were inactive, and ultimately provided more data for a given battery size. The resulting tracks of animal movement had high temporal resolution, revealing aspects of their behavior and ecology that would have been missed by traditional tags, especially for the fast-moving fisher. By dynamically linking the location schedule to animal movement rate, accelerometer-informed GPS tags reduce the trade-off between collecting detailed movement data and recording movement data for a longer period of time.

The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.

N.",Ecological conditions influence sentinel decisions,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Ecological conditions can influence decisions relating to antipredator behaviour through impacts on the likelihood of detecting predators and the ability to hear vocalizations. Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

N.",Food availability affects strength of seasonal territorial behaviour in a cooperatively breeding bird,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Seasonal patterns in territorial behaviour are common in many species, and are often attributed to the adaptive benefits of increased defence or the provision of information to potential competitors or mates during the breeding season. However, because defence behaviour is likely to be costly in terms of time and energy, an alternative possibility is that decreases in the nonbreeding season are a consequence of reduced food availability. We studied territoriality in the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird species that defends permanent territories. Groups interacted with rivals less and responded less strongly to an experimentally simulated intrusion of neighbours in nonbreeding periods compared to the breeding season. Foraging efficiency and biomass intake were significantly lower in the nonbreeding season, which resulted in birds being significantly lighter at this time of year. Finally, a feeding experiment in the nonbreeding season showed that groups given supplementary food significantly increased their response to a simulated territorial intrusion. These results indicate that the reduction in territorial behaviour during the nonbreeding season may be attributed, at least in part, to a reduction in food availability. We suggest that future studies on seasonal variation in territorial behaviour, especially those investigating species in which two or more individuals combine their defence, should take this potential constraint into account. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In seasonally driven landscapes, it is not yet clear what the primary drivers are that shape seasonal variation in vigilance and feeding rates. These rates have been shown to vary in relation to various environmental, social and individual factors, but many of these factors also vary through the year, due to variation in food supply. We studied wild female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, under low predation risk over a year to investigate whether vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally and whether this variation was mainly driven by food quantity or quality, group size or individuals' reproductive states. Both vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally, as did food quantity and quality and group size. Vigilance, including antipredator (head orientation away from the group) and exclusive (i.e. vigilance without chewing) vigilance, decreased and feeding rate increased with increasing group size. However, because group size increased with food quality and quantity, food resources emerged as the primary driver of variation in behavioural strategies. These results suggest that the observed effects of group size on the trade-off between food acquisition and safety are in fact corollaries of the seasonal variation in food supply in our study system, in which the risk of predation on adults is low, and hence are by-products of the foraging choices made by kangaroos in response to the dynamics of the quantity and quality of food.

M.; Bugnyar, Thomas",Food calling in wild ravens (Corvus corax) revisited: Who is addressed?,ETHOLOGY,"Numerous birds and mammals use vocal signals to advertise feeding opportunities but often such signals vary with individual and contextual factors. Non-breeding ravens call at food that is difficult to access, resulting in the attraction of nearby conspecifics. Although callers may benefit from group formation in various ways, we recently found substantial individual variation in food calling. We here explored whether this variation can be partly explained by the social dynamics in raven foraging groups, together with already known effects of age class and sex. Specifically, we expected ravens to respond to the presence or absence of affiliates that could act as cooperative partners in the forthcoming feeding event, that is they should call when other ravens were present but they themselves were alone rather than when they were also in company of an affiliation partner. We observed the vocal behaviour of individually marked wild ravens and, simultaneously, categorized their affiliative behaviour with other ravens in the minutes before experimentally controlled feedings. In line with our prediction, individuals were less likely to produce food-associated calls when they were in close contact with an affiliation partner prior to feeding as compared to when they were alone. Furthermore, sex and age class influenced food calling as females called more often than males and younger birds called more often than adult ravens. In conclusion, these results suggest that ravens attempt to find support from a particular cooperative partner by broadly advertise feeding opportunities via food-associated calls, especially when they have low chances in contest competition due to their age and sex. These findings lend further support to the assumption of raven flocks being structured by social relationships and individual birds flexibly controlling their vocal signalling according to the current flock composition.",2020,10.1111/eth.12991,yes,ethology,obs,Corvus_corax,passerine,bird,"direct_obs, focal_sampling",26,n/a,0.029583333,,180,B,yes,socialise,"vocalization, social","recorded food calls by ravens, not playing them back to see response",

Fire is also a major factor governing access to high-quality forage such as terricholous lichens for barren-ground caribou ( Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). Additionally, fire alters forest structure which can affect barren-ground caribou's ability to navigate in a landscape. Here, we characterize how the size and severity of fires are changing across five barren-ground caribou herd ranges in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. Additionally, we demonstrate how time since fire, fire severity, and season result in complex changes in caribou behavioural metrics estimated using telemetry data. Fire disturbances were identified using novel gap-free Landsat surface reflectance composites from 1985 to 2011 across all herd ranges. Burn severity was estimated using the differenced normalized burn ratio. Annual area burned and burn severity were assessed through time for each herd and related to two behavioural metrics: velocity and relative turning angle. Neither annual area burned nor burn severity displayed any temporal trend within the study period. However, certain herds, such as the Ahiak/Beverly, have more exposure to fire than other herds (i.e. Cape Bathurst had a maximum forested area burned of less than 4 km 2). Time since fire and burn severity both significantly affected velocity and relative turning angles. During fall, winter, and spring, fire virtually eliminated foraging-focused behaviour for all 26 years of analysis while more severe fires resulted in a marked increase in movement-focused behaviour compared to unburnt patches. Between seasons, caribou used burned areas as early as 1-year postfire, demonstrating complex, nonlinear reactions to time since fire, fire severity, and season. In all cases, increases in movement-focused behaviour were detected postfire.

Probability of a blade strike is affected by the rates at which a bird visits the rotor swept zone (RSZ), and mitigated by the behaviors it uses to avoid being struck. Between 2011 and 2013, we studied the occurrence and nature of avoidance responses of 3 nesting ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis), 5 Swainson's hawks (B. swainsoni), and 2 red-tailed hawks (B. jamaicensis) to turbines built within their territories. Two of 10 breeding males we tracked with satellite telemetry were turbine-collision fatalities, one during the study and the other in the following year. Collectively, nesting hawks displayed no macro-avoidance of turbine projects and flew adjacent to or within RSZs at high rates ((x) over bar = 0.8 visits/hr, 1.3 min/visit; n = 387 visits during 434 hr of observation) synchronized with morning and afternoon peaks in foraging activity. Passes through rotors accounted for 9.8% of responses. The turbine that hawks approached most closely from collective encounters on each territory accounted for an average of 29% of all visits to RSZs and visitation was greater than expected at turbines <0.8 km from nests (P < 0.001). As rotor speed increased, the frequency that hawks in RSZs flew between turbine rows increased relative to other avoidance behaviors and hawks that were potentially distracted (i.e., hunting or aggressive chasing) increased avoidance flights over and between turbines. The ability of hawks to employ evasive behaviors mitigated blade collision but allowed for close, hourly interaction with turbines that increased risk of collision. Where nesting populations of hawks are at risk, particularly ferruginous hawks, pre-construction siting of wind turbines needs to account for nest locations and expected high rates of hawk visitation to turbines <800 m from nests. On existing projects collision risk can be reduced through operational shutdown of turbines in this zone during 2 daily peaks in hawk foraging in the vicinity where hawks nest, but a greater effectiveness can be achieved by shutdown of specific turbines associated with highest regular use.

However, few studies have assessed hand preference in the natural repertoire of motor behaviours in nonhuman primates, especially in actions that differ in velocity. Nevertheless, velocity is involved in the coordination between the upper limb joints and could be related to cerebral hemispheric specialization. Indeed, depending on the velocity, some joints, and so some muscles, are used more than others. The purpose of this study was to quantify hand preference across various natural actions to evaluate how the nature of the action modifies hand preference in capuchin and squirrel monkeys. First, we observed seven female tufted capuchin monkeys during spontaneous foraging, performing fast actions (pounding and capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit, carrying, tapping and catching slow-moving prey). Second, we observed seven squirrel monkeys performing fast actions (capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit and catching slow-moving prey) in their enclosure. The results showed that (1) capturing fast-moving prey and pounding were associated with a left-hand preference and (2) slow actions were associated with variable hand preferences. Fast manual actions may elicit consistent hand preference. Given that many nonhuman primates use fast actions to capture prey, this possibility deserves further investigation. If this finding is confirmed, a novel link between motor control processes and hand preference can be pursued. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To address this, we assessed how abdominally implanted transmitters with percutaneous antennas affect the vertical dive speeds, stroke frequencies, bottom time, and dive duration of captive Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima). To establish baselines, we recorded video of six birds diving 4.9 m prior to surgery, implanted them with 38- to 47-g platform transmitter terminals, and then recorded their diving for 3.5 months after surgery to determine effects. Descent speeds were 16-25% slower and ascent speeds were 17-44% slower after surgery, and both remained below baseline at the end of the study. Dive durations were longer than baseline until day 22. On most days between 15 and 107 days after surgery, foot-stroke frequencies of birds foraging on the bottom were slower. Foot- and wing-stroke frequencies during descent and bottom time did not differ across the time series. If birds that rely on benthic invertebrates for sustenance dive slower and stay submerged longer after being implanted with a satellite transmitter, their foraging energetics may be affected. Researchers considering use of implanted transmitters with percutaneous antennas should be mindful of these effects and the possibility of concomitant alterations in diving behavior, foraging success, and migratory behavior compared to those of unmarked conspecifics.",2010,10.1525/cond.2010.090022,captive,telem,obs,Somateria_mollissima,waterfowl,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,
Hemingway_2018,"Hemingway, Claire T.; Ryan, Michael J.; Page, Rachel A.",Cognitive constraints on optimal foraging in frog-eating bats,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Animals are expected to optimize energy intake when choosing between different foraging options. A common explanation for deviations from optimal economic decisions is that there is an imperfect relationship between physical reality and an animal's perceptual processes, which can constrain assessment of profitability. One such phenomenon that is apparently ubiquitous across taxa is proportional processing, where a perceived change in a stimulus is proportional to the change in stimulus magnitude. In this study, we investigated whether proportional processing explains how frog-eating bats, Trachops cirrhosus, discriminate between patches of frog choruses that vary in their number of calling frogs. To test this, we created artificial choruses consisting of one to six calling frogs. In the flight cage, we then tested the preference of bats (N= 17) with every pairwise combination of chorus size. We found that while bats generally preferred larger choruses, preferences for larger choruses were better explained by the relative, not absolute, differences in chorus sizes. This indicates that T. cirrhosus is perceptually limited in its ability to discriminate between choruses of varying size as the choruses increase in size. Foragers are likely to be less choosy when choosing among larger patches. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Some behaviors will be more robust, or developmentally stable, than others in the face of the environmental novelties of captivity. Here, we investigated developmental stability of foraging behavior by quantifying bamboo feeding behavior in captive-bred and wild-born giant pandas, Ailuropoda melanleuca. As an energy-limited species adapted to a low-nutrition diet, any reductions in feeding efficiency may compromise post-release survival. Using video of 22 captive pandas, we measured several components of the panda's elaborate bamboo feeding behavior repertoire. We found that captive-born and wild-born pandas displayed the same repertoire of feeding behaviors, suggesting developmental stability in these motor patterns, but that they employed them differently with different parts of the bamboo. Captive-born pandas devoted less time and effort to handling and chewing leaves while allocating more effort to the consumption of large culms than did wild-born pandas. Captive-born pandas also handled small culm and stripped small culms to prepare them for consumption less often than did wild-born pandas. All of these behavioral differences indicate that wild-born pandas in captivity behave in a manner more similar to wild pandas, and focus their behavioral effort on more nutritious bamboo. Thus, these aspects of captive-born panda feeding behavior may be compromised, and were not developmentally stable in the captive environment. These behavioral differences are cause for concern and should be the subject of future study to determine whether they forecast compromised fitness in translocations. Evaluating developmental stability and behavioral competence should be a key component of captive-release translocation programs, serving to guide pre-release training and selection of individuals to be released.",2018,10.1111/acv.12418,captive,audio video_ethology,obs,Ailuropoda_melanoleuca,carnivore,mammal,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed behavior of wild and pen-raised bobwhites foraging under risk of predation in a captive situation at the Tennessee Tech University Avian Research Facility, Cookeville, Tennessee, USA, during March-April 2008 and February-March 2009. We hypothesized wild bobwhites were more sensitive to predation risk than pen-raised bobwhites and evaluated the relative contributions of time allocation, vigilance, and foraging efficiency in avoiding predation among wild and pen-raised bobwhites. Coveys of 4 bobwhites were presented with 3 food patches at presumed safe, moderately risky, and risky distances from cover in 10-hr trials. Food consumption, vigilance, time allocation, foraging efficiency, and average realized covey size were measured using video recordings for each patch, and compared between wild and pen-raised bobwhites and among patch risk levels. Both wild and pen-raised bobwhites foraged more in safe patches than in riskier patches. Vigilance rates were similar between wild and pen-raised bobwhites. However, pen-raised bobwhites spent more time foraging at riskier patches than did wild bobwhites. Wild bobwhites foraged more efficiently than did pen-raised bobwhites, with foraging efficiency of wild bobwhites increasing in risky patches. Greater foraging efficiency and associated shorter foraging time among wild bobwhites may make them less susceptible to predation than pen-raised bobwhites.

Andrews_2015,"Andrews, Clare; Viviani, Jeremie; Egan, Emily; Bedford, Thomas; Brilot, Ben; Nettle, Daniel; Bateson, Melissa","Early life adversity increases foraging and information gathering in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Animals can insure themselves against the risk of starvation associated with unpredictable food availability by storing energy reserves or gathering information about alternative food sources. The former strategy carries costs in terms of mass-dependent predation risk, while the latter trades off against foraging for food; both trade-offs may be influenced by an individual's developmental history. Here, we consider a possible role of early developmental experience in inducing different mass regulation and foraging strategies in European starlings. We measured the body mass, body condition, foraging effort, food consumption and contrafreeloading (foraging for food hidden in sand when equivalent food is freely available) of adult birds (>= 10 months old) that had previously undergone a subtle early life manipulation of food competition (cross-fostering into the highest or lowest ranks in the brood size hierarchy when 2 - 12 days of age). We found that developmentally disadvantaged birds were fatter in adulthood and differed in foraging behaviour compared with their advantaged siblings. Disadvantaged birds were hyperphagic compared with advantaged birds, but only following a period of food deprivation, and also spent more time contrafreeloading. Advantaged birds experienced a trade-off between foraging success and time spent contrafreeloading, whereas disadvantaged birds faced no such trade-off, owing to their greater foraging efficiency. Thus, developmentally disadvantaged birds appeared to retain a phenotypic memory of increased nestling food competition, employing both energy storage and information gathering insurance strategies to a greater extent than their advantaged siblings. Our results suggest that subtle early life disadvantage in the form of psychosocial stress and/or food insecurity can leave a lasting legacy on foraging behaviour and mass regulation even in the absence of food insufficiency during development or adulthood.

Choosing between multiple options may require additional information processing time and effort. Here, we asked if response time increases with stimulus number and attractiveness by female frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) and their predators, frog-eating bats (Trachops cirrhosus), when comparing the mating calls of male tungara frogs. We found that frogs' response time is significantly longer when presented with two calls, compared with one. Bats also take longer to respond when presented with two calls but only when they were complex calls. Although the frogs and bats behave somewhat similarly in this experiment, the decisions that these animals are making are occurring in different domains (mating vs. foraging) and have different fitness consequences. Given these differences, we find it especially interesting that for both frogs and bats, we see similar temporal patterns in response times as a function of information load.Significance statementAnimals are often faced with several options simultaneously. One cost of decision-making is the time involved in choosing the best option within a choice set. Here, we asked whether female frogs and frog-eating bats take longer to respond when presented multiple frog mating calls simultaneously. We also asked whether the attractiveness of those frog calls influences the time it takes frogs and bats to respond to them. We found that the time to respond was influenced by both the number and attractiveness of frog calls for both bats and frogs; however, frog response time seemed to be more greatly influenced by the number of frog calls, while bat response time seemed to be more influenced by the attractiveness of frog calls.

Although hunting behaviors can improve with age and experience, many precocial.species are necessarily effective predators from birth. Additionally, many predators experience innate ontogenetic shifts in predatory strategies as they grow, allowing them to adapt to prey more appropriate for their increased size and energetic needs. Understanding how the relative roles of innate age-specific adaptation and learning have evolved requires information on how predation behavior develops in situ, in free-ranging predators. However, most of the research on the ontogeny of predation behavior is based on laboratory studies of captive animals, largely due to the difficulty of following newborn individuals in nature. Here, we take advantage of the unique tracks left by juveniles of a precocial viperid, the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes), which we used to follow free-ranging snakes in the field. We recorded details of their ambush hunting behavior, and compared the behaviors of these juveniles to adult snakes that we monitored in the field via radio telemetry. Although juvenile and adult behaviors were similar in most respects, we did find that adults chose more effective ambush sites, which may be due to their increased experience. We also found that juveniles (but typically not adults) perform periodic tail undulations while in ambush, and that juveniles displayed slightly different activity cycles. Both of these latter differences are likely the result of age-specific adaptations for juveniles' greater reliance on lizards versus small mammals as prey. We also compared the general predatory behavior of sidewinders to that of other species in the genus Crotalus. These findings will provide important baseline field information for more detailed empirical research on the ontogeny of predation behavior in precocial vertebrates. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Daily seed removal rates by all birds, irrespective of species, measured by both techniques were similar with no significant interactions evident between measuring techniques, site and shrub species. Both techniques displayed higher seed removal from tiny-seeded S. mauritianum than other shrub species; this was also evident among individual bird species. However, the seed enumeration technique was unable to discriminate between foraging organisms, contamination of traps by wind-blown fruits abscised from neighbouring branches and fruit theft from the canopy and the traps.

Theoretical models predict the strength of interference at different prey densities for birds differing in dominance. Observational studies have been used to validate the theoretical predictions, but there is reason to believe that these nonexperimental studies suffer from confounding factors. We therefore manipulated forager density of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus foraging on live cockles Cerastoderma edule (low density: 1 bird per 50 m(2) and high density: 2 birds per 50 m(2)) in a unique experimental facility closely mimicking natural feeding conditions. In the high-density situation, the intake rate was on average reduced by 36% compared with the interference-free intake rate. However, this effect depended on status with intake rate of subordinates being more strongly reduced than intake rate of dominants (-45% vs. -25%). We could not investigate all possible mechanisms, but we observed that birds actively avoided each other, possibly to avoid kleptoparasitism. Our experiment shows that the decline in intake rate with increasing density of conspecifics is at least partly due to direct interactions between birds and possibly also to indirect interactions via prey depression but not to an unidentified confounding factor that covaries with intake rate and bird density, as may have been the case in nonexperimental field studies.",2010,10.1093/beheco/arq129,captive,ethology,exp,Haemoatopus_ostralegus,shorebird,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,
von_Merten_2012,"von Merten, Sophie; Siemers, Bjoern M.",Exploratory behaviour in shrews: fast-lived Sorex versus slow-lived Crocidura,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Exploration of the environment is a key behaviour in animals. The exploratory behaviour of species or populations depends on different aspects of their ecology. New evidence suggests that differences in exploratory behaviour might also be related to life history strategies, with fast-lived animals (high metabolic rate, short life span) being faster explorers than slow-lived ones. We tested this assumption in shrews. Shrews are divided into two phylogenetic groups, which differ tremendously in life history. We compared the exploratory behaviour of three species, covering both phylogenetic groups. Shrews of the fast-lived genus Sorex were quicker to start exploration and to locate the first food patch. They also moved faster than the slow-lived genus Crocidura. Unlike many studies on exploratory behaviour that analyse only a short period of time (i.e. a single exploration bout with a fixed duration), we analysed the species-specific allocation of prolonged total exploration time into exploration bouts. Using this method, we could show that Sorex performed more, but shorter exploration bouts than Crocidura. Our results support the hypothesis of exploratory behaviour being related to life history. While the species we tested occur sympatrically, the two genera differ strongly in the climatic zones they inhabit. It is likely that also during evolution they faced different types of habitat and thus different selection pressures. These differences in evolutionary histories possibly favoured the evolution of their diversified life histories and exploration strategies. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We analysed the vigilance behaviour in different types of social units of L. guanicoe, to better understand the complexity of this behaviour. The best supported models for both the frequency of vigilance and the proportion of time vigilant included the type and size of social units as the most important predictors that affect the vigilance behaviour. Solitary males devoted proportionally more time in vigilance behaviour than family, mixed or bachelor groups, whereas females in female groups spent more time vigilant than guanacos in mixed groups. Frequency of vigilance was higher in family individuals and solitary males than in bachelor or mixed groups. It is likely that that in family and females groups, the presence of offspring would increase the vigilance behaviour to detect possible predators. Topography and habitat characteristics that determine the predation risk, affected vigilance behaviour of mixed groups and solitary males.

In this study, we analyzed the defensive responses of a subterranean rodent species, the plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi), to predation threat, and examined the trade-offs between defensive responses and foraging. Plateau zokors were exposed to 1, 3, and 6 g of eagle owl (Bubo bubo) feces, and the anti-predator behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression responses were analyzed and compared with the control (distilled water). Exposure of the animals to owl feces led to significant reductions in both duration of feeding and amount of food consumed, while some defensive behavioral responses (e.g., freezing and rearing) were more significant in the exposed animals than in the control. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone in plateau zokors exposed to owl feces were significantly higher compared with the control. The hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression levels of plateau zokors exposed to 1, 3, and 6 g owl feces increased significantly, concomitant with the amount of eagle owl feces presented. Owl feces induced various behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic gene expression changes in plateau zokors exposed to them. Some behavioral and gene expression (but not hormonal) responses appeared to be threshold dependent. Significance statement Predator odors supersede other signals and can provide comprehensive information to prey during life-threatening events. The plateau zokor is a typical subterranean rodent living in dark and enclosed subterranean habitats. Owing to this special habitat, zokors may be able to recognize ground predator odors and respond defensively.

M.",Has an invasive lizard lost its antipredator behaviours following 40 generations of isolation from snake predators?,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"The introduction of species outside their native range is an insidious form of human-induced environmental change, with mounting evidence that behaviour, either through plastic behavioural responses or adaptive changes, can play a vital role in mediating invasion success. In particular, when species invade non-native habitats, they often leave behind native predators. Altered predator assemblages may then result in changes to antipredator responses overtime. Here, we capitalise on the well-characterised invasion history of an Australian reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, to investigate differences in antipredator responses between an invasive island population (Lord Howe Island) and its original mainland source (Coffs Harbour) following 40 generations of isolation. Specifically, we examined the responses of invasive and native skinks to scent cues taken from huntsman spiders, Heteropoda sp., a predator present in both populations, and red-bellied black snakes, Pseudechis porphyriacus, a predator absent from the invasive range. We measured the time skinks took to emerge from a shelter site and subsequent basking and foraging behaviours in the absence and presence of each predator scent. We did not detect any differences in responses between native and invasive skinks, although predator scent affected foraging behaviour. In a separate experiment, lizards were faced with a simulated bird strike and had the choice of retreating under a snake-scented or unscented shelter. When faced with such a threat, we found that skinks did not avoid snake-scented shelters. We also measured the activity and exploratory behaviour of each skink prior to exposure to predator cues, finding that increased activity and exploration appears to be linked to reduced antipredator behaviour for invasive but not native skinks. Contrary to our initial predictions, our results suggest that the relaxation of pressure from native predators may not necessarily translate to changes in key antipredator responses in invasive species, even after 40 generations of isolation. Significance statement Human movement introduce species into novel areas, where they are confronted with a suite of ecological challenges that must be navigated, including changes to predator assemblages, in order to successfully establish and become invasive. Altered predator assemblages encountered by invasive species may, in turn, result in changes to, or loss of, antipredator responses over time. We studied such a scenario in the delicate skink, an Australian lizard that has been repeatedly introduced to new areas. We compared the antipredator behaviour of skinks from an invasive island population to skinks from their original mainland source. We found that despite 40 generations of isolation, invasive skinks do not differ from native skinks in their antipredator behaviour. However, we found that greater activity and exploration levels had become linked to reduced antipredator behaviour in invasive but not native skinks.",2021,10.1007/s00265-021-03064-7,captive,ethology,exp,Lampropholis_delicata,lizard,reptile,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a two-phase cross-over design, marmosets (n = 16) were submitted to one trial for each stimulus, divided into four 5-min intervals: pre-exposure, exposure and post-exposure observations held 0 and 4 h later. The snake exposure increased the number of gazes made towards the stimulus and the time cage-mates spent close to each other, as well as induced tsik-tsik alarm/mobbing calls, while inhibiting foraging and decreasing the time spent near the snake's location. After the snake was removed, all changes were immediately reversed. Mobbing was not observed. The flower stimulus only increased direct gazes and time spent in proximity during its presentation. All marmosets were captive-born and snake-naive yet had recently been confronted with a cat stimulus in a previous experiment.

We examined if personality-related variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by information-gathering strategies (IGSs), where individuals vary in investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits Parus major). We found that slow exploring individuals sampled empty food patches more than fast exploring individuals, supporting the IGS hypothesis. We found no evidence for personality-related differences in feeder choice in response to changes in food availability, nor personality-related differences in flexibility in behavioral responses.",2016,10.1093/beheco/arw054,captive,ethology,exp,Parus_major,passerine,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,
Griffin_2015,"Griffin, Andrea S.; Diquelou, Marie C.",Innovative problem solving in birds: a cross-species comparison of two highly successful passerines,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Macro-ecological comparisons have repeatedly demonstrated that the taxonomic distribution of foraging innovations coincides with the ability to adjust to novel and changing environments. We sought to obtain experimental support for the link between innovative foraging and opportunism by measuring the innovation abilities of two highly successful passerines on the east coast of Australia with very different success strategies. The ecological success of the introduced Indian myna, Acridotheres tristis, has been linked to its ability to occupy opportunistically an ecological niche that most natives cannot, whereas the native noisy miner, Manorina melanocephala, owes its success to its ability to aggressively outcompete other avian species. Indian mynas were significantly more neophobic than noisy miners. Yet, when tested on a range of innovative foraging tasks, Indian mynas consistently outperformed noisy miners. The ability to use the beak in a greater range of ways, and more flexibly, was highly repeatable in Indian mynas, and underpinned their superior problem-solving performance. We discuss the results in the light of potential methodological influences, but also the idea that necessity may facilitate innovation not only in less competitive individuals, as is documented in the literature, but also in species with less competitive lifestyles.

Griffin_2014,"Griffin, Andrea S.; Diquelou, Marie; Perea, Marjorie",Innovative problem solving in birds: a key role of motor diversity,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Foraging innovations are increasingly viewed as a key source of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change. Often thought to be associated with increased cognitive abilities, innovative foraging behaviour could potentially emerge as a simple consequence of being able to use a greater variety of motor actions in the foraging context. Here, we explored the role of motor diversity in the innovative problem-solving abilities of a highly successful ecological invader, the Indian myna, Sturnus tristis, using an extractive foraging task with multiple compartments. Consistent with findings from several other species, persistence predicted the latency to solve the first compartment. However, motor diversity was the strongest predictor of both solving latency of all further compartments and number of compartments solved. We suggest that motor diversity may facilitate innovation by increasing the ways in which objects can be handled, which in turn would allow for associative learning processes to enhance the expression of successful foraging behaviours.

Griffin_2011,"Griffin, Andrea S.; Haythorpe, Kathryn",Learning from watching alarmed demonstrators: does the cause of alarm matter?,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Many social-learning opportunities expose animals to the behaviour of conspecifics, but also to causes and consequences of those behaviours. Attending to information over and above social behaviour per se may provide a strategy by which the reliability of social information is ensured. Earlier work in Indian mynahs, Sturnus tristis, has demonstrated that observers become more wary in a location in which they are accustomed to foraging after they have viewed a conspecific undergo a 'predator' attack at that site. We determined whether observation of both an alarmed demonstrator and the cause of the conspecific's alarm (capture by a human) were critical to such observational learning. Experimental observers watched a demonstrator mynah display high levels of alarm in response to pursuit and capture by a human, while control mynahs watched a demonstrator express a similar level of alarm to a threatening nearby human, but visual access to the human by observers was blocked. Analysis of observer behaviour at the feeding site both before and after observational training revealed that experimental observers remained wary at the feeding site after training relative to before, relative to control observers that became far less wary, strongly suggesting that both social and causal information were important for observational learning. This result contributes to the growing body of empirical evidence that use of social learning is modulated by a rich variety of contextual information that may help ensure that its use is adaptive.

Research on the producerscrounger game has focused mainly on the different factors influencing its evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solution, but very little is known about the actual mechanisms that shape players' decisions. Recent work has shown that early experience can affect producerscrounger foraging tendencies in young house sparrows and that in nutmeg mannikins learning is involved in reaching the ESS. Here, we show that direct manipulation of the success rate experienced by adult sparrows when following others can change their strategy choice on the following day. We presented to live sparrows an experimental regime, where stuffed adult house sparrows in a feeding position were positioned on a foraging grid that included two reward regimes: a positive one, in which the stuffed models were placed near food, and a negative one, in which the models were placed away from food. There was a significant increase in joining behavior after the positive treatment (exhibited by 84% of the birds), but no change after the negative treatment. Further analysis demonstrated that sparrows more frequently used the strategy with which they were more successful (usually joining) and that differences in strategy use were correlated with differences in success. These results suggest that adult birds can monitor their success and learn to choose among social foraging strategies in the producerscrounger game.",2012,10.1111/eth.12013,captive,ethology,exp,Passer_domesticus,passerine,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

N.; Thies, Wibke; Whitehead, Susan R.",Defensive fruit metabolites obstruct seed dispersal by altering bat behavior and physiology at multiple temporal scales,ECOLOGY,"The paradoxical presence of toxic chemical compounds in ripe fruits represents a balance between plant enemies and allies: chemical traits can defend seeds against antagonistic herbivores, seed predators, or fungal pathogens, but also can impose costs by repelling mutualistic seed dispersers, although the costs are often difficult to quantify. Seeds gain fitness benefits from traveling far from the parent plant, as they can escape from parental competition and elude specialized herbivores as well as pathogens that accumulate on adult plants. However, seeds are difficult to follow from their parent plant to their final destination. Thus, little is known about the factors that determine seed dispersal distance. We investigated this potential cost of fruit secondary compounds, reduced seed dispersal distance, by combining two data sets from previous work on a Neotropical bat-plant dispersal system (bats in the genus Carollia and plants in the genus Piper). We used data from captive behavioral experiments, which show how amides in ripe fruits of Piper decrease the retention time of seeds and alter food choices. With new analyses, we show that these defensive secondary compounds also delay the time of fruit removal. Next, with a behaviorally annotated bat telemetry data set, we quantified post-feeding movements (i.e., seed dispersal distances). Using generalized additive mixed models we found that seed dispersal distances varied nonlinearly with gut retention times as well as with the time of fruit removal. By interrogating the model predictions, we identified two novel mechanisms by which fruit secondary compounds can impose costs in terms of decreased seed dispersal distances: (1) small-scale reductions in gut retention time and (2) causing fruits to forgo advantageous bat activity peaks that confer high seed dispersal distances.",2020,10.1002/ecy.2937,yes,telem,obs,Carollia_spp.,bat,mammal,radio_triang,13,15,,233.2307692,110.5,BC,yes,resting,,"total time period is not given, but 8.5 days/bat reported",

Predator foraging strategies, however, determine exactly how search time affects predator encounter rates. Ambush predators are more likely to be encountered by females traveling longer distances to evaluate males, but evaluation time is unlikely to influence encounter-rate with this type of predator. Actively searching predators, however, may be more likely to be encountered by females employing longer travel times and evaluation times. In this study, we examine the effects of perceived search costs on both temporal and spatial aspects of the search behavior of female tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus. Females were collected from natural choruses and presented with conspecific calls at a distance of 50, 115, or 180 cm from their release point. Assays were conducted in either darkness or simulated full moon light levels. Longer starting distances caused longer choice latencies, but choice latency was considerably lowered under higher light conditions. Females spent considerably less time moving under higher light conditions; however, light levels did not affect path length. Females were more likely to leave the release point with more accurate orientation to the sound source under higher light conditions. We demonstrate that females can respond to perceived search costs by altering spatial and temporal aspects of female search behavior. The overall emphasis of females on reducing time spent moving and increasing movement speed indicates that predation by actively searching predators represents a stronger cost to females than ambush predators.",2011,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01843.x,captive,ethology,exp,Physalaemus_pustulosus,frog,amphibian,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

However, overall we still know little about the factors that foster or hinder the spread of innovations, or of the impact of individual differences in behaviour on social transmission. We used a two-action and control experimental design to study the diffusion of innovation in groups of wild-caught blue tits, and found strong evidence that individuals can use social learning to acquire novel foraging skills. We then measured six individual characteristics, including innovative problem solving, to investigate potential correlates of individual social-learning tendency. Consistent with a hypothesis of common mechanisms underlying both processes, we found evidence for a relationship between social learning and innovativeness. In addition, we observed significant age-and sex-biased social learning, with juvenile females twice as likely to acquire the novel skill as other birds. Social learning was also more likely in subordinate males than dominant males. Our results identify individual variation and transmission biases that have potential implications for the diffusion of innovations in natural populations.

Conversely, an acknowledgement of the functional diversity of learning mechanisms has led to greater understanding of the adaptive nature of cognition. In this paper, we present data from three experiments suggesting that noisy miner birds use different cognitive strategies when searching for foods with different distributions. When searching for nectar, an immobile, readily depleted resource, birds spontaneously attend to fine-scale spatial information and use a spatial memory-based strategy that is efficient in a novel context and largely resistant to disruptions to movement. When searching for invertebrates, a mobile, clumped and cryptic resource, birds employ a strategy whose efficiency increases with increased task familiarity, is vulnerable to disruptions to their movement and may rely more on memory for movement rules than memory for location information. Previous reports of adapted cognition have reported performance differences between species (for example, better spatial cognitive performance in storing versus non-storing birds). Ours is the first study to demonstrate that differences in cognitive strategy (as opposed to just enhanced performance) occur within a single species in different foraging contexts. As well as providing an example of how specially adapted cognitive mechanisms might work, our data further emphasise the importance of jointly considering functional and mechanistic aspects to fully understand the adaptive complexities of behaviour.",2011,10.1007/s00265-010-1063-4,captive,ethology,exp,Manorina_melanocephala,passerine,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

Tool use that is inflexible or requires extensive experience to change, and that is only addressed towards specific targets such as food, is not likely to reflect unusual or particularly complex cognition. On the contrary, if tools are employed flexibly and for a variety of innovative purposes, then conventional combinations of inherited predispositions and associative learning are challenged and interesting questions emerge. Since New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) are especially adept at using and making tools for food extraction, we decided to examine their ability to generalise this to other contexts. We recorded how five pairs of New Caledonian crows interacted with novel objects that were not associated with food. We observed eight occasions in which the first contact with the novel object was mediated by a tool, suggesting that the function of the tool was for exploration.

We tested how multisensory stimuli affected the antipredator behavior of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) using alarm calls as an auditory signal and flushing behavior as a visual cue. We varied the degree of risk within the group by manipulating the number of group mates alarm calling and/or flushing using robotic birds. We assumed that alarm calling and flushing were redundant stimuli and predicted that they could generate one of three types of responses (enhancement, equivalence, or antagonism) depending on the mechanism of multisensory perception. We set up an artificial flock with three robotic juncos surrounding a live junco and controlled for multiple confounding factors (e.g., identity of the focal, body mass, food deprivation time). We found that the degree of alarm of live juncos increased when at least one robot flushed. However, the time it took the live individuals to react to the robots' behavior increased, rather than decreased, with at least one alarm call. This could be the result of an orienting response or sensory overload, as live juncos increased scanning behavior after being exposed solely to alarm calls. Contrary to some theoretical assumptions, alarm calling and flushing behavior elicited independent unimodal responses, suggesting that they are non-redundant stimuli and that together they could reduce the occurrence of false alarms and facilitate flock cohesion.",2014,10.1111/eth.12212,captive,audio video_ethology,exp,Junco_hyemalis,passerine,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that this preference stems from perceptual biases in the sensory and/or cognitive systems of T. cirrhosus. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of preference experiments in which we presented bats with various modified simple calls, each altered to possess one of the acoustic properties that distinguish complex calls from simple calls. We reasoned that if perceptual bias accounts for the bat's preference for complex calls, then a novel stimulus with similar acoustic properties to the complex call should be attractive as well (i.e., the preference should be permissive). Except for weak evidence suggesting that the longer duration of complex calls could contribute to their greater attractiveness to T. cirrhosus, we did not find any indication that perceptual biases account for this eavesdropper preference. Instead, we suggest that T. cirrhosus developed their preference for call complexity because eavesdropping on complex calls provides greater fitness benefits than eavesdropping on simple calls, for example, because eavesdropping on complex calls may increase probability of prey capture and/or lead to more profitable food patches.",2015,10.1007/s00265-015-1949-2,captive,ethology,exp,Trachops_cirrhosus,bat,mammal,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

Prey have been shown to be more visible in sunlit than in shaded patches, leading to higher predation risk and more investment in vigilance (predation risk hypothesis). Additionally, prey have been hypothesized to take longer to detect predators in sunlit compared to shaded patches because of the excess of sunlight causing glare effects (disability glare hypothesis). We tested the predictions of these two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses in a seminatural experiment with brown-headed cowbirds by measuring vigilance behavior and detection of a ground predator in patches under the shade of vegetation and in the open. Light intensity and achromatic contrast were higher in the sunlit patches, which could enhance glare effects, but chromatic contrast was higher in the shaded patches. Brown-headed cowbirds took longer to show alert reactions to and flee from a ground predator in sunlit compared to shaded patches. However, the two parameters associated with perceived predation risk (vigilance prior to the predator exposure and time to resume foraging after the attack) did not differ between sunlit and shaded patches. Our findings support to a greater extent the disability glare hypothesis than the predation risk hypothesis. Overall, ambient light conditions can affect two critical components of behavioral predatorprey interactions in terrestrial habitats: detection of and escape from predators. The effects of disability glare are expected to be more pronounced in bird species with wider visual fields or without sun-shading structures; however, species may compensate through various behaviors (e.g. avoidance of sunlit patches and changes in head orientation).",2012,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2012.02020.x,captive,ethology,exp,Molothrus_ater,passerine,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,140,,,,,,

Higher montane elevations are associated with a significantly longer winter period characterized by lower temperatures and more snow, making winter survival more challenging due to a probable increase in foraging demands.

Birds from both elevations responded with increased latency to approach the novel object; however, there were no elevation-related differences. Male and female chickadees responded similarly on both tasks, suggesting no sex-related differences in problem solving ability or neophobia. The problem solving results are consistent with the results for closely related black-capped chickadees along a longitudinal gradient of winter climatic harshness on a larger geographic scale, but the response to novelty data is not.

We predicted that the ability to gather information about predator presence through chemical cues might be particularly important for ground-living and foraging bird species, since their main predators, namely mammals and reptiles, use chemical communication. In this context, we experimentally examined the role of olfaction in the nondomesticated, ground-living red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa, in a natural and context-dependent situation. We tested how individuals responded to three different olfactory stimuli, which were presented in sand bath tubs: (1) a mammalian predator (ferret faeces), (2) an avian alarm scent (alarm secretion of the European hoopoe) and (3) a control (orange oil). As dependent variables we recorded side preferences and dustbathing activity. Red-legged partridges avoided the predator scent to the same extent as the alarm scent of the hoopoe, whereas orange oil scent did not affect side choice or dustbathing behaviour of individuals. Our results indicate that red-legged partridges avoid the scent of a predator as well as the alarm scent of an avian heterospecific. In regard to this, we provide the first indication that, in risk assessment, chemical cues, similar to avian alarm calls, may possibly act as a source of information between avian species.

In this study, we compared the risk-taking behavior of urban and rural house sparrows (Passer domesticus) after simulated attacks by two of their important predators (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus and domestic cat Felis catus). The birds were startled by moving dummies of these predators and respective control objects, and their risk taking was estimated as their latency to feed after the startle. We found that sparrows responded more strongly (had longer post-startle feeding latencies) to sparrowhawk attacks than to the control object, and their responses differed between the habitats. First, risk taking of urban birds strongly decreased with age (older birds had longer latencies than young birds), while there was no such age difference in rural birds. Second, young urban birds responded less strongly, while older urban birds responded more strongly to the sparrowhawk than the same age groups of rural birds, respectively. We did not succeed in evoking antipredatory response by simulated cat attacks, because birds responded similarly to the dummy and the control object. Our results support that predation risk, posed at least by avian predators, is different in urban and rural habitats of house sparrows. The increased wariness of older, hence presumably more experienced, urban birds implies that sparrows may be more exposed to predation in cities.",2011,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01944.x,captive,ethology,exp,Passer_domesticus,passerine,bird,captive,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in some environmental contexts sensory information may be obscured. The relation between sensory organs, obstruction and searching efficiency remains little explored. In this study we experimentally examined the ways in which a sensory system ('remote detection'), which enables red knots, Calidris canutus, to detect hard objects buried in wet soft sediments, is obstructed by plants. At an important coastal nonbreeding site of this species, the Banc d'Arguin (Mauritania, West Africa), most of the intertidal foraging area is covered by sea grass. The structurally complex networks of belowground roots and rhizomes and aboveground sea grass may obstruct information on the presence of buried bivalves and thus affect searching efficiency. Under aviary conditions we offered red knots buried bivalves in either bare soft sediments or in sea grass patches and measured prey encounter rates. Red knots detected prey by direct touch in sea grass but remotely in bare sediment. Physical modelling of the pressure field build-up around a probing bill showed that within a layer of sea grass rhizomes, permeability is reduced to the extent that the pressure field no longer reveals the presence of an object. In bare sediment, where searching efficiency is constant, red knot intake rate levelled off with increasing prey density (described by a so-called type II functional response). In the sea grass beds, however, prey density increases with sea grass density and simultaneously decreases searching efficiency, which will at some point lead to a decrease in intake rate when prey densities increase (i.e. a type IV functional response). Clearly, prey detection mechanisms dictate that the combined effects of prey density and habitat complexity should be taken into account when predicting forager distributions and habitat preference.

W.",The Effects of Temperature on the Kinematics of Rattlesnake Predatory Strikes in Both Captive and Field Environments,INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,"The outcomes of predator-prey interactions between endotherms and ectotherms can be heavily influenced by environmental temperature, owing to the difference in how body temperature affects locomotor performance. However, as elastic energy storage mechanisms can allow ectotherms to maintain high levels of performance at cooler body temperatures, detailed analyses of kinematics are necessary to fully understand how changes in temperature might alter endotherm-ectotherm predator-prey interactions. Viperid snakes are widely distributed ectothermic mesopredators that interact with endotherms both as predator and prey. Although there are numerous studies on the kinematics of viper strikes, surprisingly few have analyzed how this rapid movement is affected by temperature. Here we studied the effects of temperature on the predatory strike performance of rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), abundant new world vipers, using both field and captive experimental contexts. We found that the effects of temperature on predatory strike performance are limited, with warmer snakes achieving slightly higher maximum strike acceleration, but similar maximum velocity. Our results suggest that, unlike defensive strikes to predators, rattlesnakes may not attempt to maximize strike speed when attacking prey, and thus the outcomes of predatory strikes may not be heavily influenced by changes in temperature.",2020,10.1093/iob/obaa025,captive,audio video,obs,Crotalus_spp.,snake,reptile,"CAPTIVE, cites prior papers that are already in this review",,,,,,,,,,,

Capybaras are very gregarious and often vocalize. This species emits a vocalization known as a click, which has been observed during aggregating and foraging behaviors, suggesting contact or monitoring call function. We carried out a playback experiment to evaluate behavioral responses to the capybara's click call and to a bird call, used as control in ten capybaras. We compared animals' latency to respond to stimuli, the time spent in behavioral patterns, alertness, head orientation toward the sound source, and approach to the sound source. All capybaras responded to the emission of the click call playback. Most of them assumed an alert position, showed head orientation toward the sound source, and approached the sound source. They promptly reacted to the first click call emission, while few reacted to the first bird call emission, used as control. All subjects showed behavioral changes after the second emission of the click call, and some responded to the third emission. Just three individuals answered after the first control emission, while none of them responded to the second and third emission of the playback. Therefore, click call playback promotes prompt behavioral changes in capybaras, including approach to the sound source.

Griffin_2013,"Griffin, Andrea S.; Lermite, Francoise; Perea, Marjorie; Guez, David",To innovate or not: contrasting effects of social groupings on safe and risky foraging in Indian mynahs,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Foraging innovations are increasingly recognized as an important source of phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary change and adaptation to environmental challenges. One line of research has successfully demonstrated that innovation can represent a stable individual trait, but by the same token has shown strong contextual effects on innovation. We examined the effects of social context on innovative foraging behaviour. Across two separate experiments, we measured the individual propensity of Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis, to innovate when alone, in pairs, or in groups of five birds. Although innovators remained consistent in their relative innovation performance ranking (high, medium, low), the presence of one or more conspecifics reduced the likelihood of innovating, and increased innovation latencies, significantly relative to when individuals were tested alone. A neophobia test in which latency to forage was compared in both the absence and the presence of a novel object, in each of two social contexts (solitary versus social), showed that the presence of conspecifics caused mynahs to forage significantly faster in a safe situation (object absent) relative to when alone, but to delay foraging in a risky situation (object present). Together, these findings suggest that sociality can have contrasting effects on foraging in safe and risky situations, and, in some species at least, effects of sociality on innovative foraging may hence be more akin to those observed in the presence of risk. Negotiation over engaging with risks inherent to innovative foraging offered the most likely explanation for socially inhibited innovation behaviour, and may act to constrain the diffusion of innovations under some conditions.

Hemingway_2019b,"Hemingway, Claire T.; Ryan, Michael J.; Page, Rachel A.",Transitive foraging behaviour in frog-eating bats,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Most models of animal foraging assume that individuals make decisions rationally. One expectation of rationality theory is that preferences should be hierarchical or transitive. For many animals, including humans, making decisions about what to eat can become difficult when various parameters of choices are not positively related to one another and no single option may be considered the best. These complex decisions can result in irrational behaviour, suggesting that the value of any particular option may vary depending on the other available options. Here, we tested whether frog-eating bats, Trachops cirrhosus, are transitive in their preferences for frog calls. These bats attend to several attributes of the calls, such as call amplitude and complexity, when choosing a frog to target in their attack. While acoustic preferences are largely understood in isolation, we have a limited understanding of how bats choose between calls that vary along several important acoustic dimensions. Here, we conducted a series of binary choice experiments manipulating amplitude and complexity both separately and together to evaluate whether these bats make transitive foraging decisions. We found that bats are transitive in their rankings of calls based on these acoustic dimensions, with preferences reflecting a trade-off between both amplitude and complexity. Overall, our results add support to the notion that bats' preferences obey the general principles of rational behaviour and support the use of optimality approaches to the study of animal behaviour and decision making.

Measuring individual, group and environmental characteristics",ETHOLOGY,"For specialised feeders, accessing food resources may impact on the performance of appetitive foraging and social behaviours at individual and population levels. Flamingos are excellent examples of social species with complex, species-specific feeding strategies. As attainment of coloured plumage depends upon intake of dietary carotenoids, and as study of free-ranging flamingos shows that foraging is disrupted by aggression from other birds, we investigated the effect of four feeding styles on foraging and aggression in captive lesser flamingos. We evaluated individual and group differences in foraging and aggression when birds consumed bespoke flamingo pellet from a bowl, an indoor feeding pool and an outdoor feeding section of their pool. Natural foraging (when birds were feeding irrespective of the presence of pellet) was recorded for comparison with artificial feeding styles. One-minute long video footage of the birds' activities in these different locations, recorded between 2013 and 2016, was used to evaluate behaviour. Total number of seconds engaged in feeding and in aggression was recorded by continuous sampling. The colour of individual birds was scored from 1 (mainly white) to 4 (mainly pink). For natural filter feeding in the outdoor pool, maximum foraging was twice as much as bowl feeding, whilst aggression was less than half as much as other feeding methods. Overall, a more restricted feeding style significantly predicted aggression, along with increasing group size. Plumage colour significantly influenced aggression (brightest flamingos were more aggressive) and showed a non-significant trend with foraging (brighter birds fed less than paler birds). No sex effect on feeding or aggression was found. This study enhances our understanding of husbandry and species' biology impacts on captive behaviour and provides data-based evidence to improve food presentation. For flamingos, implementation of spacious outdoor feeding areas can encourage natural foraging patterns by reducing excess aggression and enhances welfare by improving flock social stability.",2020,10.1111/eth.13067,captive,audio video_ethology,obs,Phoenicopterus_minor,flamingo,bird,CAPTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we analysed data from satellite transmitters deployed on 35 adult female flatback turtles nesting in the vicinity of an iron ore port to understand the spatial and temporal components of the main phases of their breeding cycle and assessed overlap with this industrial activity. During the inter-nesting phase, flatback turtles remained 14 +/- 9 km from their nesting site. On their transit to foraging grounds they did not use a discrete corridor, using an area from the coast out to the 50 m contour and dispersed widely to foraging grounds (18 to 1326 km away) that had low spatial overlap among individuals. The home range of 94 % of turtles during inter-nesting, 26% during outward transit and 3% during foraging had overlap with the shipping channel associated with the port. Although these results suggest that risks associated with vessel collision would be increased during the nesting season and early part of the transit to foraging grounds, no such impacts were detected. Outside of these times (>80% of the time), industrial activities in this area are likely to be low risk to flatback turtles from the main studied rookery. We also provide the first information on the diving behaviour and in situ water temperature data of flatback turtles during the post-nesting migration, showing that turtles forage both on the benthos and within the water column, and that some turtles forage in relatively deep and stratified water.",2018,10.3354/meps12650,marine,telem,obs,Natator_depressus,turtle,reptile,MARINE,35,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from four habituated groups of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in Central Africa, we investigated the possible influence of ecological (food type and quantity) and social factors (presence, arrival and departure of specific group members) on food call production. Western gorillas emitted food calls mainly in foraging contexts. The emission probability increased with food types of high quality (in relation to the season) and, particularly, with abundant food patches. Food calls elicited the arrival of group members at the feeding tree. Adult females, the most frequent signallers, mostly emitted food calls when the silverback and all offspring were absent at the feeding tree, when compared to the absence of other group members. From the receiver perspective, the probability that the silverback and all offspring arrived at the feeding tree increased when adult females emitted food calls. When calling, adult females likely benefit by increasing both nutritional intake and protection of their own offspring (by increasing spatial proximity with the silverback). Moreover, food calls emitted in the second part of the duration of tree visits had the strongest effect on the prolongation of the feeding session. Our results suggest that the adaptive reasons of food calls in one-male harem species may be increasing group cohesion/coordination and facilitating offspring survival. Significance statement The adaptive reasons for the widespread presence of food calls in many animal species aremultiple and not mutually exclusive. We showed that western gorilla emitted food calls mainly in foraging contexts; they attract other group members and deliver information on the presence of abundant resources of high quality. Food calls emitted in the second part of the tree visit seem to prolong the feeding session. Adult females, the most frequent signallers, emitted food calls more often when their offspring and the silverback are absent. These results suggest that, in species with rather stable society (such as one-male harem), this behaviour may serve to increase cohesion/coordination and to facilitate offspring survival.

Sales_2021,"Sales, Raul Fernandes Dantas; Freire, Eliza Maria Xavier",Reproductive behavior of Spix's Whiptails in the wild: understanding the costs and benefits of mate-guarding,ACTA ETHOLOGICA,"Across animal taxa, females of non-territorial species have potential opportunities to mate with multiple partners; hence, the primary mechanism available for males to ensure paternity is to guard the receptive female after copulation and repel other males. Hypothetically, mate-guarding is costly for males in terms of energy acquisition and increased risk of injury, and beneficial for females in terms of decreased harassment by other males and an increase in available foraging time. Here, we provide a detailed description of mating behavior and test these hypotheses in the Spix's Whiptail (Ameivula ocellifera). Mating behavior is characterized by the following events: (1) a male courts a female in the entrance of her burrow; (2) if courtship is accepted by the female, a consensual copulation occurs; (3) after copulation the male accompanies the female during her daily activity, being aggressive towards other males; (4) when the female returns to the burrow, the companion male remains vigilant at the entrance and repels rival males. Besides the mate-guarding strategy, alternative mating tactics are adopted by some males that do not guard females after courtship and consensual copulation, while others try to copulate opportunistically with a female without prior courtship. Companion males spent more time vigilant, less time actively foraging, and captured less prey when compared to solitary males. Accompanied females captured prey in a similar proportion to solitary females but spent more time vigilant and less time foraging. Companion males won 100% of their interactions with rival males, chasing them away from the females. Accompanied females hence did not suffer harassment from other males when companion males were close. Our results evidence energetic costs of mate-guarding for males but not increased risk of injuries. By accepting mate-guarding, females do not appear to have energetic gains and lose the advantage of cryptic mate choice but can benefit from access to high-quality males and protection from harassment.",2021,10.1007/s10211-020-00360-9,no_access,ethology,obs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We collected behavioural and diet data via scan sampling for 9 months (3 months/season), and estimated the fruiting source density. Fruit resources were significantly more available in the 2012 dry season than the 2012 rainy and 2013 dry seasons. Overall, foraging and moving were the main activities, and fruits and exudates were the principal food items consumed. During the rainy season, the common marmosets devoted more time to eating fruits, increased the niche breadth and food source revisitation frequency, and used the forest's middle-strata more often. When we compared between-year data, we found that common marmosets rested more frequently, fed more often on invertebrates and had a broader niche breadth in the 2012 dry season than in the 2013 dry season. The availability of specific fruit resources and invertebrates appeared to influence study group activity budget and diet. Variation in food availability may have reduced diet niche breadth and stratum use.

Previous technologies have relied upon techniques with very low spatial or temporal resolution, such as VHF telemetry. Rather incongruously, therefore, relatively simple underground activity regimes have often been assumed, with insufficient attention to the ecological importance of burrow use. We test the capability of Magneto-Inductive (MI) tracking, recording underground movement within a European badger sett over a 2week period in February. These data allowed us to: quantify subterranean movement; extrapolate the three-dimensional burrow architecture; simultaneously track multiple individuals; and establish the function of specific movement patterns; demonstrating the technique's utility. Contrasting data generated using MI tracking, against the resolution achievable with VHF tracking, we establish how sampling frequency can influence the perception of movement. Taking 20 locational fixes per minute, MI collars operated for 1year before on-board batteries failed, resulting in an average five billion data points per collar deployment. Socio-ecologically we found that rather than foraging continuously throughout the night, badgers returned to the sett an average of 22 times, approximately every 3-4h. From burrow mapping, badgers tended to use peripheral chambers for c. 45min on these return visits. These outlying chambers were used less by day, when badgers selected deeper chambers, suggesting each chamber type fulfils a different function. This technology also exposed that badgers exhibited a far greater extent of underground movement than revealed by former technologies, which by comparison captured <05% of subterranean activity. Importantly, these high-resolution data showed that individuals left, returned to, and moved about the sett independently, with no tendency for synchronous subterranean activity. In overview, Magneto-Inductive tracking proved relatively simple and cost-effective to deploy, it provided very detailed and accurate subterranean fixes, and was robust enough for long-term field deployment. Furthermore, the capabilities of MI are highly transferable, enabling a better understanding of underground activity and the ecological importance of subterranean burrows for the conservation and management of a wide range of species.",2015,10.1111/2041-210X.12348,no_foraging,magnet_telem,obs,Meles_meles,carnivore,mammal,VALIDATION - no actual foraging measured,,,,,,,,,,,

High-flying, open-space foragers are especially underrepresented by mist-net surveys. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of using acoustic lures (playbacks of conspecific vocalizations) to increase capture success of bats in mist nets. We tested the efficacy of an acoustic lure to capture a high-flying rare molossid, the endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus), which had been captured only once away from a known roost prior to our research. We used a crossover experimental design with 2 lure treatments (nets with lures playing social call recordings from 2 different roosts) and 2 control nets (no lures) in 6 sites for 2 nights each. We captured 15 Florida bonneted bats in our treatment nets and 0 in our control nets. One lure had greater capture success (n=13) than the other (n=2), with a trend for greater captures of males (n=11) than females (n=4). We suggest that these differences were due to the social context in which the calls used in the lures were recorded. Our study demonstrated the utility of acoustic lures to capture Florida bonneted bats and expands research opportunities critical to the species' conservation, such as the ability to use radio telemetry to track captured bats to unknown roosting and foraging areas. Our study also lays the foundation for future research into social call playbacks as a technique to lure other high-flying and elusive bat species into mist nets.

Activity levels were stored on an hourly basis throughout the annual cycle, allowing periods of resting/sleep, continuous flight and intermediate activity (foraging, breeding) to be distinguished. Measurements from a light sensor were stored from preprogrammed key stationary periods during the year to provide control information about geographic location. Successful results, including annual actogram, were obtained for a red-backed shrike Lanius collurio carrying out its annual loop migration between northern Europe and southern Africa. The shrike completed its annual migration by performing > 66 (max. 73) nocturnal migratory flights (29 flights in autumn and > 37, max. 44, in spring) adding up to a total of > 434 (max. 495) flight hours.

Given that movements at various scales are assumed to be linked, the space use of temperate ungulates within seasonal ranges (winter, summer) should be related to their movement patterns at the annual scale. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level of stationarity of moose (Alces alces) within their seasonal ranges and to link annual movement patterns to within-season space use. We analysed the ranging behaviour of 32 moose fitted with GPS collars from two study areas in Eastern Poland, where at the annual scale a fraction of individuals migrate between summer and winter ranges (partial migration). Our results revealed that moose stationarity within seasonal home ranges expressed remarkable variation. The probability of moose stationarity within seasonal ranges was significantly higher (by 23%), and the mean home range size tended to be lower (9.7 km(2)) among individuals that seasonally migrated than among non-migratory moose (14.3 km(2)). In addition, we found that (i) in summer, moose were significantly more stationary (by 19%) and exhibited a smaller mean home range size than in winter (9.0 and 15.9 km(2), respectively) and (ii) the mean seasonal home range size of males (19.6 km(2)) was remarkably greater than that of females (9.6 km(2)). Given the significant link between annual and seasonal scales of animal movements, any environmental change (e.g. climate warming) affecting an animal's annual movement strategy could alter within-season animal space use and presumably individual fitness. Significance statement To maximize their fitness, animals adjust their movements to deal with variations in resource distribution in the landscape. The scale of spatio-temporal variation causes different types of migratory behaviours, ranging from year-round stationarity to migration, when individuals establish spatially separated seasonal ranges. Studies on ungulates suggest that the stability and the size of seasonal home ranges can be linked to annual movement behaviour. Using the locations of GPS-tracked moose, we demonstrate in this study that migratory individuals were more prone to establishing stable seasonal home ranges (especially in summer) than moose that occupied the same area throughout the year. Moreover, stable seasonal home ranges were remarkably smaller in summer than in winter, which may suggest a season-specific spatial distribution and a renewability of moose forage. Our results show a clear link between different temporal scales of animal movements.",2021,10.1007/s00265-021-03059-4,no_foraging,remote,obs,Alces_alces,ungulate,mammal,"MIGRATION, NOT FORAGING",,,,,,,,,,,

In highly polygynous species such as many cervids, males are regarded as pure capital breeders, in that they allocate the energy stored in spring and summer to reproduction. According to the predation risk hypothesis, best foraging strategies adopted before the rut may imply a risk because, in order to invest in body size, males exploit the best feeding areas, even though characterized by higher predation risk. We performed a 9-year research through monitoring 31 fallow bucks in the lekking population of San Rossore, Italy. Among the mating strategies adopted by males, defence of the lek territory was repeatedly shown to be the most successful one. A sector of the study area was characterized by the highest meadow productivity and the highest predation risk. We showed that only those males that exploited the best feeding and yet risky areas before the rut to a greater extent, hereby investing in body size, were subsequently more likely to defend a lek territory. Males that during their life reduced the use of best feeding areas before the rut, were less likely to defend a lek territory during the rut. Among territorial males, which adopted the same spatial and foraging strategies before the rut, only few achieved a high mating success during the rut, suggesting that many other factors (phenotype, experience from previous mating seasons, and that gained as subadult males) along with foraging strategies may simultaneously contribute to explain the variability of mating success among territorial males in a lek.",2011,10.1163/000579511X563981,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Dama_dama,ungulate,mammal,"MATING BEHAVIOUR, NOT FORAGING",,,,,,,,,,,

Arndt_2018,"Arndt, Robert J.; O'Keefe, Joy M.; Mitchell, William A.; Holmes, Jordan B.; Lima, Steven L.",Do predators influence the behaviour of temperate-zone bats? An analysis of competing models of roost emergence times,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Temperate-zone bats likely feed in an environment with few dangerous nocturnal predators, suggesting a life largely free of the antipredator trade-offs faced by most other animals. Such bats may, however, encounter dangerous diurnal raptors with an early start to their nightly feeding, and thus may face predation-related trade-offs in deciding when to emerge from a daytime roost. Non-predator-related factors could also come into play in this nightly decision. We used an information-theoretic approach to examine which combination of a wide range of variables exerts the greatest influence over emergence times from maternity roosts in a population of Indiana bats, Myotis sodalis, covering a 12-year period. Our competing statistical models were based on two broad environmental influences on emergence times: predators and physical (meteorological and astronomical) variables. The best-performing model included most of the variables associated with antipredator trade-offs, assuming that bats emerging before or near sunset experience a foraging benefit and a substantial risk of predation by diurnal raptors. Accordingly, state-dependent behaviour was apparent, with emergence beginning earlier during the more energetically demanding portion of the reproductive cycle. During lactation (the most demanding period), about 20% of emergence events began before sunset, compared to only 5% during colony formation. Earlier emergence was also associated with high cloud cover (darker conditions), larger roost populations and roosts located deep into the forest. Moonlight at sunset, however, was absent from the best-supported model and had no apparent influence on emergence times. Overall, the emergence behaviour of our species is consistent with a trade-off between energetic needs and predation risk, most likely due to the temporal overlap of early emergences with the activity period of diurnal raptors. This behaviour may be more common than expected in temperate-zone bats. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) is a specialised rodent hunter that forms family groups with cooperative breeding but also lives as monogamous pairs in suboptimal areas. Given the apparent absence of fitness gains to helpers from cooperative breeding, we set out to explore the benefits accrued by communal territorial defence measured as the acquisition and retention of habitats with more and most preferred rodent prey. Pairs defended relatively large territories to encompass critical amounts of key habitats within a matrix poor in rodents. Groups in optimal areas had relatively small territories and were expansionist, such that wolves in larger packs benefited per capita from increased good-quality foraging habitat. The fitness benefits of philopatry became evident after a rabies epizootic, when philopatry and expansionism prevailed in under-saturated conditions, until large groups split or provided dispersers that established locally. This study shows that high concentrations of prey can shift the balance of costs and benefits towards group living and cooperation in long-lived territorial carnivores, in so far as this dictates immediate rewards accrued from a given increment in territory size, namely greater foraging area per animal, leading to group enlargement and eventual inheritance of breeding space.",2012,10.1007/s00265-012-1348-x,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Canis_simensis,carnivore,mammal,"not foraging, just group size/membership",17,95,,,,,,,,,

To ensure the long-term viability of top carnivore populations, it is important to understand their ecology and behavior throughout their remaining range, including in protected areas, as these can act as vital refuges. In Sri Lanka, an endangered, endemic leopard sub-species (Panthera pardus kotiya) is the apex predator, and while its island-wide distribution is influenced by forest cover and protection level of the landscape, ecological and anthropogenic influences of finer scale landscape utilization are poorly understood. In the interior of Sri Lanka's largest protected area, Wilpattu National Park, we used remote cameras and a spatially explicit capture-recapture methodology to estimate leopard population density and quantify relative prey availability. We then employed linear models to compare four alternative hypotheses proposed to identify factors influencing observed leopard habitat selection within the PA. Adult leopard density was estimated at 10.4 individuals/100 km(2) which is at the higher end of the global spectrum of recorded leopard densities, and only marginally lower than other Sri Lankan National Parks which appear to have considerably higher available prey abundance. Leopard site utilization increased with increasing distance from park boundaries, suggesting the presence of edge effects due to anthropogenic disturbance. Leopard occurrence was also higher close to grazing lawns used by prey but not areas of higher prey abundance, evidence of 'leap-frogging', whereby carnivores bias movement toward spatially anchored preferred resources of their prey instead of prey directly. The relatively high core area leopard density, combined with avoidance of boundary areas and frequent observation of injuries suggests the possibility of density-dependent intra-specific competition and needs to be further investigated.

Slagsvold_2021,"Slagsvold, Tore; Wiebe, Karen L.",Egg covering in cavity nesting birds may prevent nest usurpation by other species,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Some birds cover their eggs with nest material when they leave to forage. It has been suggested that such egg-covering aids thermoregulation or prevents predation but here we present a new hypothesis, that secondary cavity-nesting species cover their eggs to prevent nest usurpation by other birds. When the bottom of the cavity is dark, as when eggs are covered by nest material, it may be difficult for a prospecting competitor to see whether a defending nest owner or a predator is hiding inside the cavity. Competitors may therefore hesitate to enter dark cavities. We filmed 21 great tit (Parus major) nests during the egg-laying period and found that the female spent bouts of highly variable length outside the nest box (range 0.3-250 min, n = 51), so prospecting small passerines would have difficulty predicting whether an aggressive tit owner was in the box or would soon return. We presented prospecting male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with a dyad of boxes (n = 93), each containing a great tit nest but only one with visible eggs. Flycatchers hesitated more to enter a nest box with no visible tit eggs than a box with exposed eggs. This was most evident for nest boxes with dark versus light interior paint, supporting the idea that better interior illumination makes prospecting birds more confident about entering an unfamiliar cavity. The usurpation and predation hypotheses are not mutually exclusive because both competitors and small predators may hesitate to enter dark, enclosed spaces if visibility is low. Significance statement Some birds deposit a layer of material on top of the eggs when they leave the nest. Several hypotheses have been proposed for such egg covering, for example that it may insulate the eggs and reduce the risk of nest predation. We propose a new hypothesis, namely that secondary hole-nesting birds cover their eggs when they leave the nest to prevent usurpation of the cavity by other birds. Great tits that we filmed at the nest during the egg-laying period could be absent for long periods. To test the hypothesis, we presented male pied flycatchers, potential nest competitors, with a dyad of nest boxes, each containing a great tit nest but only one with visible tit eggs.

We found no differences between sexes in stopover duration or refueling index, although we did find subtle sex differences in the onset and end of diel activity. Males of both species began to forage earlier in the morning than females in 2015, and adult males of both species ended diel activity later in the evening than adult females in 2014 and 2015. More obvious were annual differences in stopover duration and the timing of diel activity, with shorter stopovers and an earlier onset of diel activity in the year with a warmer spring. We also did not find any evidence that sexes differed in their postdeparture ground speeds or migration routes.

Travel route optimization or resource acquisition constraints usually lead to repeated sequences of visits, which may have major evolutionary and ecological implications. However, the study of this behavior has been impaired by a lack of concepts and methodologies. We here formally define routine movement behavior, provide an index that quantifies the degree of repetitiveness in movement sequences in terms of minimal conditional entropy, and design a flexible procedure that detects the specific subsequences that are repeated. We demonstrate our framework using computer simulations and real-world movement data of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) introduced into a novel environment. The simulation example showed that our methods can suitably reveal the increase in the level of routine movement behavior during home range (HR) establishment. Black-tailed deer did not show such an increase, suggesting that HR establishment occurred very fast. In both examples, our procedure determining the subsequences that are repeated provides a precise visualization of routine movements. Our approach solves limitations in the study of routine movement behavior and thus opens promising perspectives for the study of the linkages between cognition, foraging strategies, and environments. Although we developed it to study routine movement behavior, it can be applied to any type of behavioral sequence and should thus be of interest to a broad range of behavioral ecologists.",2017,10.1093/beheco/arw154,no_foraging,ethology,exp,Odocoileus_hemionus,ungulate,mammal,"GPS, NOT FORAGING",4,n/a,,10080,210,,,,,,

In lieu of quantifying fitness effects directly, which is often difficult, behavioural functional responses provide insight into how animals balance trade-offs, and into thresholds in responses to environmental change. Here, we explore this principle using the response of moose Alces alces L. to roads and restricted-access tracks as a case study. Because roads are associated with the conversion of conifer to mixed deciduousconifer forest that provides better foraging opportunities, moose in Ontario favour areas of moderate road density at a landscape scale. At a finer scale, however, moose avoid roads. These opposing effects indicate a costbenefit trade-off. We quantified behavioural responses of moose to roads using road-crossing rate. An expected distribution of crossing rates was derived from correlated random walk null model simulations. Moose exhibited a seasonally variable, nonlinear functional response in road-crossing rate at the within seasonal range scale. A pronounced response to roads was observed when road density reached approximate thresholds of 0 center dot 2 and 0 center dot 4kmkm2 in summer and winter respectively. Road-crossing rate was proportional to road density, though crossing rates were higher in summer than winter. Crossing rates were best explained by the interaction between mean movement rate and road density. Seasonal differences in road-crossing rate arise from seasonal differences in movement rate and seasonal range area, but not road density within seasonal ranges. Within the protected park, moose did not appear to respond to tracks. Our analysis implies that for the majority of the landscape outside of protected areas the response of moose to roads is pronounced. Synthesis and applications. Identifying thresholds in nonlinear responses to landscape modification is a key management objective as they represent transition zones where small changes can have disproportionately large effects on wildlife populations. We establish these thresholds for moose and roads, but find no response to tracks, implying that the effects of tracks can be mitigated by restricting access to them.

Roberts_2013,"Roberts, Su-Jen; Cords, Marina",Group size but not dominance rank predicts the probability of conception in a frugivorous primate,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"In social mammals, within-group competition for food can drive variation in female fitness. Frugivores may face particularly strong competition because they use patchily distributed usurpable resources. Dominance rank and group size influence how a female experiences within-group competition. Both are predicted to affect access to food and, thus, reproductive success. We used 15 years of behavioral, demographic, and reproductive data from wild frugivorous blue monkeys to examine effects of rank and group size on the probability that a female conceived. We used generalized linear mixed models, controlling for potentially confounding maternal and environmental factors. Blue monkey females compete aggressively and disproportionately for fruits and exhibit linear dominance hierarchies, but neither rank index we tested significantly predicted the probability of conception. Although earlier studies found that group size effects on activity budgets were minimal, we found that group size had a quadratic relationship with the probability of conception, which peaked at around 31 members. The lack of a rank effect may reflect behavioral strategies (e.g., switching resources, spreading out during feeding, using cheek pouches) that minimize the strength of within-group competition, thus facilitating group-level cooperation in between-group contests. The significant quadratic effect of group size on reproduction may occur if individuals in small groups do not obtain the full benefits of group living (e.g., predator avoidance, increased foraging success, communal care for offspring) and those in large groups experience a lower quality diet or constrained feeding time. Ultimately, measures of reproduction are preferable to behavioral proxies for accurately assessing within-group competition.",2013,10.1007/s00265-013-1607-5,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Cercopithecus_mitis,primate,mammal,NOT FORAGING,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated habitat selection and range use of adult little owls Athene noctua in relation to landscape configuration, habitat structure and resource distribution. We determined the preference of habitat structures by VHF-telemetry. Large- and fine-scale distribution patterns of voles - the main prey during the breeding season - were assessed by transect counts of signs of vole presence. An experiment using artificial perches was carried out to determine the fine-scale adjustment of the owls' range use in relation to prey abundance and vegetation height. Habitat selection and resource exploitation by little owls were structured at all spatial levels: (1) at the landscape scale, orchards were highly preferred over other areas. This accords with the patchy large-scale occurrence of voles, which were absent in cropland, but abundant in orchards and grassland; (2) within home-ranges, the spatial distribution of voles was highly inhomogeneous and structures with high prey abundance were used over-proportionally; (3) at the scale of foraging sites, little owls preferred patches with low vegetation over those with high prey abundance, establishing that prey availability is the crux. The results suggest that all levels of habitat selection and range use were related to farming practices and affected by current cultivation. Conservation measures should focus on the conservation and restoration of orchards on the landscape level and habitat management measures should focus on grasslands - the main food providers - by creating a mosaic of patches with short grass and tall grass. Together with other habitat structures providing food resources such as field edges, wildflower areas and structures facilitating access to prey, the quality of habitat patches in terms of food availability may be highly improved.",2018,10.1111/acv.12361,no_foraging,telem,obs,Athene_noctua,raptor,bird,NOT FORAGING,,,,,,,,,,,

The prey's cost of moving, thereby abandoning crypsis due to immobility, therefore decreases. Cost of not moving increases over time if movement is required for prey to conduct fitness-enhancing activities. We tested a cost-benefit model that predicts effects of factors that affect predation risk and cost of not moving on a prey's latency to flee. Acting as simulated predators, we conducted experiments on the lizards Iberolacerta cyreni and Podarcis lilfordi. All predictions for 5 risk factors and a cost of moving factor were verified. Lizards fled sooner when the predator stood closer, approached rapidly rather than slowly before stopping, approached directly rather than indirectly, and gazed at the lizard rather than away from it, and after the second of 2 successive approaches. Latency to move was shorter in the presence than absence of a mealworm, suggesting the importance of opportunity cost of immobility. The effect of standing distance has 2 components, greater rate of detection by the predator and greater risk of being captured if detected at shorter distances. Escape theory has been highly successful in predicting how close a prey allows a predator to approach before fleeing. Our model extends an economic approach to study of escape decisions in response to an immobile predator that may be an ambush forager or an active forager that has stopped moving nearby.",2012,10.1093/beheco/ars032,no_foraging,ethology,exp,"Iberolacerta_cyreni, Podarcis_lilfordi",lizard,reptile,"FID, but DIDN'T LOOK AT FORAGING REALLY",,,,,,,,,,,

However, how functionally different prey species respond to predation risk and how prey strategies vary across ecosystems and in response to predator reintroduction are poorly understood. We investigated the spatial distributions of six African herbivores varying in foraging strategy and body size in response to environmental factors and direct predation risk by recently reintroduced lions in the thicket biome of the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, using camera trap surveys, GPS telemetry, kill site locations and Light Detection and Ranging. Spatial distributions of all species, apart from buffalo, were driven primarily by environmental factors, with limited responses to direct predation risk. Responses to predation risk were instead indirect, with species distributions driven by environmental factors, and diel patterns being particularly pronounced. Grazers were more responsive to the measured variables than browsers, with more observations in open areas. Terrain ruggedness was a stronger predictor of browser distributions than was vegetation density. Buffalo was the only species to respond to predator encounter risk, avoiding areas with higher lion utilization. Buffalo therefore behaved in similar ways to when lions were absent from the study area.

However, differences in spatial and temporal resolution between movement and remote sensing data limit their direct assimilation. In this context, we built a data-driven framework to map resource suitability that addresses these differences as well as the limitations of satellite imagery. It combines seasonal composites of multiyear surface reflectances and optimized presence and absence samples acquired with animal movement data within a cross-validation modeling scheme. Moreover, it responds to dynamic, site-specific environmental conditions making it applicable to contrasting landscapes. We tested this framework using five populations of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) to model resource suitability related to foraging achieving accuracies from 0.40 to 0.94 for presences and 0.66 to 0.93 for absences. These results were influenced by the temporal composition of the seasonal reflectances indicated by the lower accuracies associated with higher day differences in relation to the target dates. Additionally, population differences in resource selection influenced our results marked by the negative relationship between the model accuracies and the variability of the surface reflectances associated with the presence samples. Our modeling approach spatially splits presences between training and validation. As a result, when these represent different and unique resources, we face a negative bias during validation. Despite these inaccuracies, our framework offers an important basis to analyze species-environment interactions. As it standardizes site-dependent behavioral and environmental characteristics, it can be used in the comparison of intra- and interspecies environmental requirements and improves the analysis of resource selection along migratory paths.

Proximate factors (behavioural variety, persistence, selectivity and experience) provide behavioural mechanisms that also affect problem-solving performance. Our aim was to assess the link between personality and problem-solving performance in wild-caught, common brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, and to assess their learning capability. We tested how possums, a native marsupial inhabiting the inner urban environment of Sydney, Australia, solved an escape box problem in the field. Possums could solve this problem by either pushing (easy) or pulling (difficult) a door. We quantified personality traits, including exploration, activity and vigilance, in a separate arena test. We found that personality traits affected problem solving. Exploratory animals were more likely to succeed in their first trial irrespective of task type, but only highly exploratory individuals were likely to solve the difficult task. More active and more vigilant individuals were also more likely to succeed, regardless of task type. For mechanistic behaviours employed during the problem-solving test, individuals spending more time engaged (persistent) were less likely to succeed in the easy task, because they focused more on nonfunctional parts of the box. In contrast, persistent individuals were more likely to succeed in the difficult task. Possums learnt effectively, solving tasks substantially faster on their second attempt. Our study provides the first demonstration of problem solving in free-ranging marsupials using an ecologically relevant test. This allows future comparison of behavioural commonalities and tests of convergent evolution in problem solving among taxa. Furthermore, while personality traits influenced problem-solving capability, we suggest that the rapid improvement in problem solving by all possums through experience and learning helps explain their success in dealing with artificial or novel problems associated with the urban environment.

Birds seem to maximize migration speed in different ways as a noteworthy variation in migration strategies exists. We studied migration strategies of a flight mode and feeding generalist, the Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus, using GPS-based satellite telemetry. We expected the gulls to achieve very high overall migration speeds by traveling via the shortest direct route, traveling during a large part of the day and night, and making few and short stopovers. Fourteen individuals were tracked between the Dutch breeding colony and the wintering sites in England, southern Europe and northwest Africa. The gulls did not travel via the shortest possible route but made substantial detours by their tendency to follow coasts. Although the gulls traveled during most of the day, and sometimes during the night, they did not achieve long daily distances (177 and 176 km/day in autumn and spring, respectively), which is explained by the gulls stopping frequently on travel days to forage. Furthermore, due to frequent and long migratory stopovers, their overall migration speed was among the lowest recorded for migratory birds (44 and 98 km/day, in autumn and spring, respectively). A possible explanation for the unexpected frequent stopovers and low migration speeds is that gulls do not minimize the duration of migration but rather minimize the costs of migration. Energy rather than time might be important for short-distance migrating birds, resulting in very different migration strategies compared with long-distance migrants.",2012,10.1093/beheco/arr150,no_foraging,remote,obs,Larus_fuscus,charadriform,bird,GPS - MIGRATION NOT FORAGING,,,,,,,,,,,

Their vagility hinders data collection on abundance and distribution, which constrains modeling efforts and our understanding of bat ecology, viral dynamics, and spillover. We addressed this knowledge gap with models and data on the occurrence and abundance of nectarivorous fruit bat populations at 3 day roosts in southeast Queensland. We used environmental drivers of nectar production as predictors and explored relationships between bat abundance and virus spillover. Specifically, we developed several novel modeling tools motivated by complexities of fruit bat foraging ecology, including: (1) a dataset of spatial variables comprising Eucalypt-focused vegetation indices, cumulative precipitation, and temperature anomaly; (2) an algorithm that associated bat population response with spatial covariates in a spatially and temporally relevant way given our current understanding of bat foraging behavior; and (3) a thorough statistical learning approach to finding optimal covariate combinations. We identified covariates that classify fruit bat occupancy at each of our three study roosts with 86-93% accuracy. Negative binomial models explained 43-53% of the variation in observed abundance across roosts. Our models suggest that spatiotemporal heterogeneity in Eucalypt-based food resources could drive at least 50% of bat population behavior at the landscape scale. We found that 13 spillover events were observed within the foraging range of our study roosts, and they occurred during times when models predicted low population abundance. Our results suggest that, in southeast Queensland, spillover may not be driven by large aggregations of fruit bats attracted by nectar-based resources, but rather by behavior of smaller resident subpopulations. Our models and data integrated remote sensing and statistical learning to make inferences on bat ecology and disease dynamics.

For prey that exhibit behavioral signs that they have detected predators, alert distance is the predator-prey distance when the prey performs the behavior and then continuously monitors the predator's approach. Many other prey do not usually give any indication of having detected a predator prior to fleeing. This is especially likely in prey having laterally placed eyes that are approached from one side, as in typical studies of lizards. We conducted field trials to detect overt signs of monitoring by zebra-tailed lizards, Callisaurus draconoides, which usually exhibit no signs of monitoring. When a researcher walked in an arc starting at some distance from a lizard's side and continuing until he was directly in front of or behind it, the lizard cocked its head and/or reoriented its body or fled and then reoriented. These behaviors allowed lizards to keep the researcher in view as he passed out of a monocular visual field. The findings demonstrate that monitoring occurs in these lizards, suggest that monitoring is so important that lizards risk being detected by moving, and suggest a possible method for studying effects of alert distance in prey that do not perform alerting behaviors when approached in full view. Alerting responses have been observed infrequently in lizards because researchers are in one of the wide lateral visual fields when they start to approach. Unless the predator moves out of view, prey with limited or no binocular vision have no need for postural adjustment to focus on the predator.",2015,10.1007/s00265-015-1951-8,no_foraging,ethology,exp,Callisaurus_draconoides,lizard,reptile,"direct_obs, predator_simulation - BUT NO FORAGING",44,0.2,,,,,,,,,

In predator communities, interspecific interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors; therefore, the behavioural patterns of composing species will differ due to locally adapted interactions. We deployed 32-41 camera-traps in five study areas across the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the temporal relations between mesocarnivores in SW Europe. The selection for a period of the diel cycle and plasticity in activity patterns was evaluated using the Jacobs Selection Index (JSI) and the coefficient of activity overlap (a dagger(1)). Furthermore, we investigated whether temporal shifts can facilitate coexistence by reducing activity overlap. Seven species of mesocarnivores were detected and were assigned into one of three behaviourally distinct groups: diurnal (JSI(day) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8), strictly nocturnal (JSI(night) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8) or facultative nocturnal species (0.4 a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand JSI(night) > 0.8). Most species exhibited substantial flexibility, which allowed them to locally adapt their foraging strategies (intraspecific a dagger(1) = 0.70-0.77). Mean Delta(1) from all interspecific pairwise comparisons was negatively correlated with the number of carnivore species with a parts per thousand yen10 detections (r -0.76, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that temporal segregation is likely to play an important role in facilitating mesocarnivore coexistence, especially with increasing community complexity, where most species' activity peaks were asynchronous.

Migratory movements in the opposite direction to the prevailing seasonal routes had been seldom studied and are considered to be an exceptional behavior of animals. Here we present novel insights on avian movement and challenge the traditional perspective of avian migration, by revealing an exceptional movement pattern. We combine analyses of a large dataset based on high-frequency GPS animal tracking data, deployed on the breeding population of the Judean long-legged buzzardButeo rufinus(LLB), along with analyses of remotely sensed data (of a satellite-based greenness index NDVI - normalized difference vegetation index) to reveal the migratory patterns of this population. This species had never been tagged before and its annual movements were previously unknown. We show that the Judean LLB population is migratory rather than sedentary, and that this population performs a poleward non-breeding migration from their southern breeding grounds in Israel to their northern non-breeding grounds in Syria, Turkey and Russia. We suggest that this unusual phenomenon is likely related to food availability in their breeding and non-breeding grounds. We provide support to the hypothesis that LLBs occupy rich environments, track specific ecological productivity levels along latitude gradients, and maintain consistently lower NDVI levels across their annual cycle compared to NDVI values available in their respective home range. These low NDVI levels are linked to the foraging ecology of LLBs, which forage in relatively open areas characterized by low vegetation. To the best of our knowledge, we present here a most extreme departure from the seasonally appropriate migratory direction of most avian species, by showing a significant poleward non-breeding pattern and by providing a possible suggestion for this behavior.",2020,10.1111/jav.02362,no_foraging,remote,obs,Buteo_rufinus,raptor,bird,"GPS, NOT FORAGING",12,215,,96713.33333,4,,,,,,

The crowding mechanism underlies most regulation models in ungulate demography and relies on the assumption of an equal share of available supplies among individuals. In contrast, in territorial systems dominant individuals monopolize resources, predicting deviations from the expected demographic outcomes under the crowding approach. We used empirical data on a protected guanaco (Lama guanicoe) population to test competing hypotheses about crowding and territorial defense as the mechanism driving density regulation in a resource-defense polygyny ungulate. We assessed density dependence on recruitment at different spatial scales and density effects on preferred forage availability. The guanaco density inside the reserve increased rapidly and then stabilized during the last third of the study period. The absence of density effects on recruitment questions the existence of crowding mechanisms. Guanaco numbers stabilized below the environmental carrying capacity predicted by an equal share of available forage, supporting territorial defense as the mechanism shaping population density in the area. Variability in forage cover was independent from changes in population density, rejecting crowding effects on food supplies. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a self-regulatory mechanism derived from resource defense that may prevent overgrazing. Our findings suggest that other factors in addition to food availability may determine the demographic carrying capacity under resource defense systems, stressing the importance of accounting for behavioral traits when addressing management issues.",2016,10.1093/beheco/arv207,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Lama_guanicoe,ungulate,mammal,"population survey, NO FORAGING",,22,,,315,,,,,explicitly says how much of the area of the park has been surveyed!,

The natural expansion of the wolf (Canis lupus) into the Alps provided the rare opportunity to monitor the responses of a prey species to the return of a large predator. Density effects have rarely been considered in the study of antipredator strategies. We examined the effects of wolf recolonisation and density modifications on group size and use of safe areas by Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) in Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), where no large terrestrial predator has been present for about a century. We documented that, in a few years, the variation in the factors affecting the landscape of fear caused significant modifications in ibex behavioural patterns that could not be accounted for by density changes only. Male groups decreased in size and moved closer to safer areas. The distance of female groups from refuge sites, instead, was not affected, and their propensity to live in groups was scarcely modified. Behavioural modifications likely caused a reduction in nutrient intake in adult male ibex, as they necessarily used lower-quality feeding patches. Our results showed that male and female ibex, which are characterised by a strong dimorphism, adopted different strategies to solve the conflicting demands of foraging efficiently and avoiding predators.",2019,10.1111/eth.12887,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Capra_ibex,ungulate,mammal,"direct_obs, NOT BEHAVIOUR",,17,,,1080,,,,,,

Various hypotheses explain sexual segregation in terms of social or habitat factors. The factors controlling sexual segregation are as yet unclear and the hypotheses put forward to explain it have generated contradictory results, indicating that different mechanisms can be involved. We analysed the three components of sexual segregation (i.e. social, spatial and habitat) in a red deer, Cervus elaphus, population of a Mediterranean-type mountainous environment. We also examined age-and offspring-related segregation. Aiming to understand the role of social interactions and habitat preferences for red deer segregation, we used 5 years of direct observations of animals. Adult males and sexually active females showed complete segregation during the year except in the rut and autumn seasons, showing that a red deer tends to be aggregated with its peers outside the reproductive period. The results suggested that red deer segregated not only by sex, but also between age classes, indicating that sexual segregation hypotheses need to explain more than differences between sexes. Furthermore, both social behaviour and habitat preferences contributed significantly to sexual segregation, indicating that this phenomenon results from different choices made by males and females with respect to security and food availability in their living areas and dissimilar social behaviour of different sexes and age classes.

Models of such relationships can be applied in reverse to translate easily observed foraging behaviors into assays of habitat attributes that cannot (easily) be measured directly. One such model analyzes the speed of a forager flying between patches, where it captures prey. Faster flight shortens the travel time and hence elevates the intake rate, but is increasingly expensive. The model shows that the net intake rate is maximized at the point at which the energetic cost of flight is equivalent to the net rate of intake. Easy-to-measure flight speeds can thus be translated into hard-to-measure foraging intake rates using established flight power relationships. We studied nonbreeding Pacific dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica) at 4 intertidal sites on the Fraser River estuary, British Columbia, Canada. These sites differed sufficiently that we expected food availability and hence the attainable foraging rate to differ. We measured interpatch flight speeds of dunlins foraging along the tideline within each site. The measured ground speed, calculated airspeed, and the statistically derived zero-wind effect airspeed all differed significantly between sites, matching in rank order our expectation of habitat quality based on their physical differences. Intake rate estimates ranged from 4.10 W (best mudflat) to 3.48 W (poorest). We think it unlikely that we would have been able to find such small differences using direct measures of foraging intake.",2016,10.1093/beheco/arv223,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Calidris_alpina,shorebird,bird,NOT FORAGING,,,,,,,,,,,

These responses relate to trade-offs between foraging and predator avoidance. Following the extirpation of predators from many landscapes, the responses related to predator avoidance may have been lost or diluted. Investigating the activity pattern of prey species on comparable landscapes with and without large predators provides an opportunity to understand how predators may shape prey activity and behaviour. Using camera trap data from neighbouring fenced sections of the Addo Elephant National Park (Eastern Cape, South Africa), we investigated the activity patterns of species exposed to large predators, where the predators were only present in one of the sections. Our results suggest that prey species at risk of predation (e.g., buffalo, kudu and warthog) are more likely to be active diurnally when co-existing with nocturnally active predators, thereby reducing the activity overlap with these predators. In the absence of predators, kudu and buffalo were more active at night resulting in a low overlap in activity between sections. Warthog activity was predominantly diurnal in both sections, resulting in a high overlap in activity between sections. The presence of predators reduced the nocturnal activity of warthogs from 6 to 0.6 % of all warthog captures in each section. Elephants, which are above the preferred prey weight range of the predators and therefore have a low risk of predation, showed higher overlap in activity periodicity between predator-present and predator-absent areas.

This trade-off is particularly salient for mammals in which mothers bear the exclusive burden of lactation and draw from their own energy reserves to provision offspring. The degree to which lactation impacts future reproductive ability should vary not only by the absolute cost of milk production but also by the ability of individual mothers to afford it. Few studies have been able to quantify the costs of lactation or how they affect reproductive rates. Here, we examine the metabolic load of lactation in chimpanzees, a species with intensive parental investment and extremely slow reproductive rates. We used urinary C-peptide of insulin to trace changes in energetic condition in 17 wild, unprovisioned chimpanzee mothers in Kibale National Park, Uganda. C-peptide levels of nursing mothers were depressed for six months postpartum, thereafter showing a net increase through the second year. These changes are consistent with milestones of infant physical and behavioral development. Mothers inhabiting lower quality foraging areas experienced a higher metabolic load of lactation, as indicated by lower C-peptide profiles than mothers in food-rich areas. Ovarian activity was closely correlated with energetic condition. Cycling resumed only after a sustained period of energy gain, suggesting that the slow reproductive pattern in wild chimpanzees results not only from the direct expense of milk production but also from the long period that mothers require to recover their physical condition in a food-limited environment.",2012,10.1093/beheco/ars107,no_foraging,ethology,obs,Pan_troglodytes,primate,mammal,NOT FORAGING,12,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report results of an extensive population-level study conducted through one-time censuses in urban India to understand the foraging associations of free-ranging dogs. We built a model to test if the observed groups could have been formed through random associations while foraging. Our modeling results suggest that the dogs, like all efficient scavengers, tend to forage singly but also form random uncorrelated groups. A closer inspection of the group compositions, however, reveals that the foraging associations are non-random events. The tendency of adults to associate with the opposite sex in the mating season and of juveniles to stay close to adults in the non-mating season drives the population towards specific aggregation.

The niche reduction hypothesis (NRH) predicts that the realised niche of declining species is reduced by threats that are mediated by environmental, biotic and evolutionary processes, explaining why species decline in some locations but not others. The critically endangered central rock-rat (CRR) survives only in rugged mountain range habitat in central Australia and is highly vulnerable to cat predation. We predicted that cat density and ranging behaviour, and, hence, predation risk, is mediated by habitat complexity, thus explaining the mechanism maintaining the CRR refuge. Aims. We sought to determine whether cat densities were lower in the rugged CRR refuge than in an adjacent valley dominated by less complex rocky habitats and no longer occupied by CRRs. Methods. We installed arrays of camera traps along two parallel mountain ranges in the refuge and in the intervening valley habitats. We identified uniquely patterned individual cats and compared spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) models to evaluate our hypothesis that cat density varies with topographic complexity. Key results. The dominant effect in all models was the significant negative relationship between cat detection probability and fine-scale topographic ruggedness. Two of the best three SECR models indicated lower cat densities and relative home-range sizes in the refuge than in the valley. In total, 17% of cats were detected in both habitat types. Conclusions. We found some evidence that cat density and home-range size were mediated by habitat complexity.

The aim of this study was to test the predictions associated to the different hypothesized costs of transience by studying the vigilance and foraging behaviour of wild wintering siskins foraging at three bird tables with different predation risk and interference competition levels. Transient siskins showed longer scan durations than residents, either because of site unfamiliarity or subordination (i.e. prior-occupancy effect). However, residents and transients did not differ in aggression rates, contrary to the dear-enemy effect. Transient siskins did not show a higher allocation of time to vigilance, contrary to the hypothesis of compensation vigilance to reduce predation risk by dispersing animals. Moreover, transients increased pecking rate with increasing predation risk, showed lower scan rates, longer foraging bouts and, in males, presented marginally higher proportions far from cover. Altogether these results strongly support the hypothesis that transients incur a predation cost due to a less efficient vigilance and foraging system.",2014,10.1111/eth.12243,provisioned,ethology,exp,Carduelis_spinus,passerine,bird,PROVISION,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a detailed dataset of observations from high-quality video recordings in the 2 regions with the most diverse and abundant populations of European avian scavengers. Active feeding time varied between species, with the obligate scavengers spending more time eating. The way that scavengers ate the food (i.e., on the ground or carrying away) diverged among species, with species with longer and more pointed beaks and a greater prehensile ability (of talons to grip things) carrying the remains away more often. We recognized the diversity and complementarity of strategies aimed at exploiting the same resource by different species and age classes. Scavenger species were clustered according to the relationship between the time active at the feeding site and the number of feeding pecks, leading to a decrease in competition for resource exploitation, as well as an occupation of specialized trophic niches.

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences affect choice performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavioral syndromes.Significance statementNectar-feeding bats, like other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild, free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest. Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few visits on each feeding trip. This suggests that individual foraging strategies might be associated with differences in foraging efficiency.",2019,10.1007/s00265-019-2637-4,provisioned,ethology,exp,Glossophaga_commissarisi,bat,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,

Sampling behavior of individual jays was moderately repeatable within and between winter field seasons and was positively correlated with birds' willingness to approach a novel object and take food in front of a predator mount. These results suggest that food sampling is a measurable component in the suite of traits comprising the Steller's jay behavioral syndrome.

The roots of this social organization have to be researched at the individual level, considering adaptations that improve fitness in hostile environments. We used information collected by camera-traps at artificial feeding sites, in two contrasting environments in Bulgaria (mountain habitat) and Italy (sub-Mediterranean habitat). We recorded 417 and 885 distinct groups on 7 and 11 foraging sites in Bulgaria and Italy, respectively. We computed (controlling for time range, study area and supplementary feeding site) an index of effective foraging time of the different social groups. We observed a positive and significant effect of the number of conspecifics of the same social group on the effective foraging time. The impact of the other social classes on effective foraging time is also positive, and males, yearlings, and juveniles benefited more from the presence of other social classes, while females were less affected. The access of the different social groups to foraging sites is not random. Males and yearlings play producers (i.e., search for food) and are prone to attend foraging sites before adult females and subadults, so attaining a larger foraging efficiency with respect to a situation where other groups are already present on the feeding site. Wild boars exhibit a more complex social organisation than previously believed, where cooperation prevails largely on competition. A rough division of labour is also present: yearlings, males, and juveniles use to play producers and assume a significant amount of risk determined by the presence of predators or hunters.

More specifically, we investigate if non-traplining animals engage in a behavior called defense by exploitation, which is characterized by an increase in visitation rates with increased intra-specific competition. We ran four tests with two gerbil species in the Negev Desert. Firstly, we measured patch use of Gerbillus pyramidum and Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi. We assumed that activity and competition would decrease through the night and that patch use would decrease with number of visits. Secondly, we measured how the number of visits to resource patches increased with the addition of individuals. Thirdly, we repeated this experiment, but instead removed individuals. Lastly, we conducted a simulation to compare these results against theoretical expectations. In the first test, we found support for defense by exploitation in G. pyramidum.

However, for reasons that remain unclear, not all species naturally use tools. Racoons (Procyon lotor) are generalist carnivores that possess many of the physical, cognitive, and behavioural characteristics linked to tool use in other species (e.g. manual dexterity, tactile exploration, relatively large brains, extractive foraging, and sociality). Although raccoons have not been observed using tools outside of experimental captive conditions, wild data involving objective psychometric tests are needed. The current study administered a tool-related task to a wild population of raccoons from 20 locations within the Croatan National Forest, USA. The task required participants to use a stick to extract food from a pipe. To facilitate interpretations of their performances on the task, data were obtained on natural tool availability at the field site and participants' mode of exploring the novel task. None of the participants solved the task despite natural sticks (suitable for solving the task) being widely available across testing locations. Participants were equally likely to smell versus handle novel sticks, which were provided at testing platforms. Limited tactile exploration, but not tool availability, could be at least one factor that reduces these raccoons' opportunities to interact with and learn about novel tools like sticks.",2021,10.1007/s10071-020-01430-y,provisioned,ethology,exp,Procyon_lotor,carnivore,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether predation risk through moon phase and exposure to the faecal odour of a natural predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, affect feeding behaviour and physiological response in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Antipredatory response was studied by live trapping under new and full moon in odourless control areas and areas experimentally manipulated with red fox fresh faeces. Food intake by individuals was determined as the amount of bait remaining in each trap and the physiological response was measured non-invasively analysing faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM). Traps treated with faeces of red fox were the most avoided, and this avoidance was more significant during full moon. Food intake by wood mice varied according to the moon phase being significantly lower under full moon nights. We found sex, breeding condition and weight of individuals explaining the variation found in FCM concentrations, but no changes in FCM levels due to moon phase or exposure to red fox faeces were detected. These results indicate that wood mice avoid red fox faecal odour and this antipredatory response as well as feeding behaviour are significantly influenced by moon phase.

In the southwestern deserts of North America, anecdotal evidence suggests provisioning birds with food and water attracts rattlesnakes to exurban yards, either indirectly by increasing prey availability or directly through attraction to water. We conducted the first experimental test of this hypothesis by providing bird seed, water, or bird seed and water at 2 national monuments in Arizona, USA, and followed the responses of adult western diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) equipped with radio-transmitters, and endothermic prey species, primarily rodents, birds, and lagomorphs.

Overall, spatial responses by adult rattlesnakes were weak, but several subjects appeared to respond to individual treatment grids. We did not find evidence of a direct response by rattlesnakes to supplemental water.

Although inbred males produced fewer offspring, inbred males that resided at the nest of their female partner had offspring with increased reproductive success, resulting in equal numbers of grand-offspring produced by inbred and noninbred males.Costs associated with antipredator behaviors can have profound effects on prey populations. We investigated the effects of predation risk on white-tailed deer foraging behavior by manipulating predator distributions through exclusion while controlling for effects of habitat type. In 2003, we constructed predator exclosures on 4 of 8 approximately 40-ha study plots in southwestern Georgia, USA. We examined the seasonal and sex-specific effects of predator exclusion, and group size and composition on the behavioral state (i.e., feeding or vigilant) of foraging white-tailed deer at baited camera traps during 2011-2012. Predator exclusion resulted in a 5% increase in the time females spent feeding during the summer, concurrent with fawning; and 13.4% increase in the time males spent feeding during winter, while in postrut condition. Males were more vigilant than females and demonstrated a stronger response to predator exclusion. Males showed no response to group size or composition, whereas females and juveniles decreased foraging when males were present during the summer. Our results suggest that white-tailed deer alter vigilance levels in response to predator distributions independent of habitat cues. We propose that expanding coyote populations in the southeastern USA influence white-tailed deer numerically through predation of juveniles, and behaviorally by inducing antipredator responses that likely carry foraging costs. This emerging predator-prey dynamic may have strong nonconsumptive effects on naive white-tailed deer populations that experienced little nonanthropogenic predation risk for decades.",2015,10.1093/beheco/arv054,provisioned,ethology,exp,Odocoileus_virginianus,ungulate,mammal,"camera_trap, PROVISIONED",,3.2,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether smaller-sized hosts (e.g., mice), with their high metabolism and constant needs for energy acquisition, can afford the same behavioral strategy. In this study, we used laboratory and field experiments to test whether feces-contaminated patches are avoided by the Taiwan field mice Apodemus semotus. In the laboratory experiment, wild-caught mice whose parasitic infection was not manipulated were given two options to forage from feces-contaminated and uncontaminated patches. These naturally infected mice spent less time in feces-contaminated than uncontaminated patches. In the field experiment, we reduced gastrointestinal parasite load of randomly chosen mice via anthelmintic treatment. Whereas the untreated mice did not discriminate among food patches with different levels of parasitism risk (i.e., high- or low-risk patches containing conspecific feces of high or low parasite egg counts, no-feces patches containing no feces), the treated mice spent less time in feces-contaminated patches than in no-feces patches. Similar to the larger-sized ungulates, we demonstrated here that small mammals can also exhibit fecal-avoidance foraging. Furthermore, such behavior may be influenced by both environmental parasitism risk and host infection status, which has implications in host-parasite transmission dynamics, namely the selective use of uncontaminated patches by the less-infected (treated) mice may drive parasites to aggregate within the infected portion of a host population.",2016,10.1111/eth.12521,provisioned,ethology,exp,Apodemus_semotus,rodent,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly the case in urban habitats where the disturbed environment can alter natural behavior from that in undisturbed habitats. The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), is an increasingly common invasive species, predominantly associated with large urban centers. Using an experimental approach, we tested the behavioral responses of native garden birds in response to the presence of a rose-ringed parakeet versus the presence of a similarly sized and dominant native bird, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). Parakeet presence significantly reduced feeding rates and increased vigilance among native birds compared with our control treatments. Of visits made by native birds in the presence of a parakeet, feeding was more likely to occur in sites within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggesting some habituation of native birds has occurred following prior exposure to parakeets but overall foraging behavior is still disrupted.

Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects.

However, we do not yet know whether juveniles learn from this aspect of the adults' behavior. Here we examine whether juveniles learn to associate food-offering calls with a foraging substrate, as a step toward assessing whether these calls qualify as teaching behavior. We compared the performance of four wild juvenile golden lion tamarins that were introduced to a novel substrate while exposed to playbacks of food-offering calls (experimental condition) to the performance of three juveniles that were exposed to the novel substrate without the presence of food-offering playbacks (control condition). We varied the location of the novel substrate between trials. We found that food-offering calls had an immediate effect on juveniles' interactions with the novel substrate, whether they inserted their hands into the substrate and their eating behavior, and a long-term effect on eating behavior at the substrate. The findings imply that juvenile golden lion tamarins can learn through food-offering calls about the availability of food at a substrate, which is consistent with (but does not prove) teaching in golden lion tamarins through stimulus enhancement. Our findings support the hypothesis that teaching might be more likely to evolve in cooperatively breeding species with complex ecological niches.",2018,10.1007/s10764-018-0069-z,provisioned,ethology,exp,Leontopitcheus_rosalia,primate,mammal,"playback, PROVISIONED",35,6 points,,,,,,,,,

However, less is known about whether prey species modify their behavior in response to predator body and behavioral cues. Recent studies indicated that tufted titmice, a small songbird, decreased their foraging behavior and increased their calling rates when they detected a potential predator facing toward a feeder they were using, compared to a potential predator facing away from that feeder. Here, we tested whether related Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, were also sensitive not just to the presence of a predator model, but to its facial/head orientation. Although chickadees are closely related to titmice, recent studies in different populations suggest chickadees respond to risky contexts involving predators differently than titmice. We conducted two field studies near feeders the birds were exploiting. In Study One, a mask-wearing human observer stood near the feeder. In Study Two, a model of a domestic cat was positioned near the feeder. In both studies, the potential threatening stimulus either faced toward or faced away from the feeder. Chickadees avoided the feeder more in both studies when the potential predator was present, and showed strongest feeder avoidance when the potential predator faced toward the feeder. Chickadee calling behavior was also affected by the facial orientation of the potential predator in Study 1. These results suggest that, like titmice, chickadees exhibit predation-risk-sensitive foraging and calling behavior, in relation to facial and head orientation of potential threats. These small birds seem to attend to the likely visual space of potential predators. Sensitivity to predator cues like behavior and body posture must become more central to our theories and models of anti-predator behavioral systems.",2016,10.1111/eth.12438,provisioned,ethology,exp,Poecile_carolinensis,passerine,bird,PROVISIONING,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk avoidance was analyzed by live trapping with control traps and traps treated with feces of common genet Genetta genetta (direct cue of risk) under new moon nights and following by simulated full moon conditions (indirect cue). The time devoted to foraging behavior and capture time were analyzed by video recording mice activity around traps. Food intake was calculated based on the amount of bait remaining in each trap. Fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) were measured by enzyme-immunoassay as indicators of physiological stress responses. Fewer wood mice were captured during full moon, yet only non-breeding adult males clearly avoided common genet odor. Mice were captured sooner at night during the simulated full moon conditions and later in predator-treated traps. Foraging activity was lower when individuals faced predator's feces, but neither food intake nor FCM levels were affected by predation risk cues. Direct and indirect cues of predation risk selectively affected wood mice behavior, although behavioral responses seem to be modulated by different costs-benefit balances related to the individual's perception of risk.

Variation in the vigilance of foraging chipmunks in response to experimental manipulation of perceived risk,ETHOLOGY,"Vigilance is a behavior in which an organism is gaining information about its environment, often used for predator detection. Vigilance is influenced by the risk that an organism perceives. Animals may vary their use of vigilance behaviors by modifying not only the percent time they dedicate to vigilance, but also the duration of vigilance bouts, rate of vigilance bouts, and type of vigilance posture. Assuming these different vigilance tactics come at different costs to the individual, different sources of perceived risk should elicit specific vigilance strategies. Here, we experimentally altered the sight lines of foraging Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). We carried out our field work in three locations in Michigan that vary from low (an island site) to high predator pressure. Our results show that chipmunks respond to changes in their immediate microhabitat by altering the rate of vigilance, regardless of predator density. On the other hand, chipmunks at sites with lower predator densities spend less time vigilant when compared to sites with higher predator densities and they utilize vigilance postures that decrease vigilance but do not completely halt feeding. Further research should aim to quantify costs and benefits of vigilance postures and strategies to further our understanding of how individuals balance the trade-off between mortality and energy gain.",2021,10.1111/eth.13128,provisioned,ethology,exp,Tamias_striatus,rodent,mammal,"camera_trap, PROVISIONED",,0.064,,,,,,,,,

However, maximally heat-conserving postures may hinder a bird's ability to escape attack, leading to a trade-off between predation risk and thermoregulation. Such a trade-off implies that birds should use the most heat-conserving postures only at very cold temperatures. Feeding in a relatively low-risk environment should also facilitate the use of such heat-conserving postures. In this experiment, we examined the effect of thermoregulatory postures on the time to initiate escape in feeding dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) exposed to a sudden sharp noise. Birds using progressively more heat-conserving postures required significantly more time to initiate flight, with a 50% increase or more for certain cumbersome postures when compared with the most flight-ready posture. This increase in the time needed to become airborne likely leads to an increase in the predation risk during an attack. Although this increase in risk could not be quantified, the delays associated with the most heat-conserving postures could allow a hawk to approach approximately 1.7 m closer to its prey during an attack. Postures that limit escape were used to a greater degree when feeding near cover and in cold conditions, lending additional support to a predation-thermoregulation trade-off. However, the effect of flock size was inconsistent and no effect of the nearest neighbor distance on thermoregulatory posture was detected. Overall, the results of this study provide insight into the seemingly intuitive observation that birds use maximally heat-conserving postures only under very cold winter conditions.",2012,10.1093/beheco/arr208,provisioned,ethology,exp,Junco_hyemalis,passerine,bird,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,

C.; Schuett, Wiebke; Griffith, Simon C.","High air temperatures induce temporal, spatial and social changes in the foraging behaviour of wild zebra finches",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Understanding how heatwaves affect organisms is becoming an important issue in animal behaviour, given the changing climate. Exposure to high air temperatures can lead to lethal hyperthermia, when individuals are no longer able to maintain body temperature within their optimal physiological range. Animals will rapidly adjust their behaviour, prioritizing heat dissipation through activities such as drinking and sitting in shade to maintain their body temperature over other activities, such as foraging. Here, we used an automated logging system to consider both the spatial and temporal foraging patterns under a range of different air temperatures at an individual level, in a strictly granivorous species in the wild. We continuously monitored individual foraging activity of wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, a species well adapted to arid conditions, in an Australian arid area across two heatwave events. High air temperatures significantly reduced foraging activity, with the extent of this effect depending on the time of day. They also led to a significant decrease in the number of birds foraging together and to birds spending a higher proportion of their foraging activity close to a water supply. As temperatures exceeded 35 degrees C we saw a significant escalation of heat dissipation behaviour. Our results indicate that extreme air temperatures significantly affected temporal, social and spatial characteristics of zebra finch foraging behaviour and these are likely to adversely reduce an individual's capacity to forage efficiently, and consequently its food intake in the short term, while also potentially having implications for both reproduction and survival in the long term.

Carr_2010,"Carr, Jennie M.; Lima, Steven L.",High wind speeds decrease the responsiveness of birds to potentially threatening moving stimuli,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Small foraging birds often rely on visual cues to detect the movement of potential threats. However, feeding in a high wind environment presents the challenge of interpreting the movements of many stimuli, most of which convey little information pertinent to survival. A bird that responds to each of these wind-driven movements would likely suffer the loss of much feeding time. Birds should thus become less responsive to moving stimuli at greater wind speeds. Furthermore, since inanimate objects should not move upwind, birds should generally be more responsive to upwind movements than typical downwind movements. By exposing passerine flocks to a moving, potentially threatening stimulus at various wind speeds, we found that these birds are in fact less responsive to stimulus movement (i.e. a lower tendency to flush to cover) as wind speed increases. However, birds were not more responsive to upwind movements of the stimulus. The propensity to flush was also not significantly affected by temperature or flock size. Responsiveness tended to decline over time, possibly indicating habituation to the stimulus, but the basic effect of wind speed held over the entire study. The general effect of wind on responsiveness suggests that the likelihood of responding to other stimuli or disturbances on windy days may also be reduced.

Observations indicate that their chosen anvils are generally hard enough to crack open casings, suggesting an understanding of the physical properties that render an anvil suitable for cracking. We report results from two field experiments investigating spatial and physical aspects of anvil selection in a wild group of banded mongooses. Mongooses rapidly carried prey items to nearby anvils in their environment, without simply returning to the last anvil they passed, suggesting a detailed knowledge of anvil locations. Moreover, in choice experiments with hard or soft anvils, they always chose the appropriate anvil when both anvils were natural but chose indiscriminately when they were synthetic. These results support a recent suggestion that mongooses lack a generalized understanding of the functional properties of anvils but also indicate that they may mediate their decisions on the basis of familiarity. Together, our experiments suggest that mongooses employ simple rules of thumb that, in most cases, result in the selection of appropriate anvils. Where environmental problems are limited and predictable, selection will favor the evolution of such rules of thumb rather than a more generalized understanding of functional properties.

Persons_2017,"Persons, William E.; Eason, Perri",Human activity and habitat type affect perceived predation risk in urban white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus),ETHOLOGY,"Predation risk is one of the largest costs associated with foraging in small mammals. Small mammals select microhabitat features such as tree and shrub canopy cover, woody debris and vegetative ground cover that can lower the risk of detection from predators and provide greater protection if discovered. Small mammals also increase foraging activity and decrease selection for cover when cloud cover increases and moon illumination is less. Often researchers assume small mammals in urban areas respond to these cues in the same manner as in natural areas, but these cues themselves are altered in urban zones. In this study, we investigated how Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) and coarse woody debris (CWD) affected giving-up density (GUD) in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Each of three habitat treatments (open flood channel, the edge and interior of the honeysuckle patch) contained cover treatments with coarse woody debris present or absent. The six treatment combinations were compared to environmental variables (temperature, humidity and illumination) and habitat variables to test their effect on GUD. Peromyscus leucopus foraged to lower densities in areas with CWD present and also under the honeysuckle canopy, using this invasive shrub to decrease predation risk, potentially increasing survivability within this urban park. Increased human presence negatively affected foraging behavior across treatments.

Foraging increased as humidity increased, particularly under the honeysuckle canopy. Changes in illumination due to moonlight and cloud cover did not affect foraging behavior, suggesting urban light pollution may have altered behavioral responses to changes in light levels.

Predation risk and resource availability in the environment may be crucial in deciding how cautious individuals should behave during foraging. These costs and benefits will vary in time and context, meaning that animals should be able to adjust their foraging behaviour to new or altered environments. Studying how animals do this is essential to understand their survival in these environments. In this study, we investigated the effect of both insularity and urbanization on risk-taking and neophobia during foraging in the Dalmatian wall lizard (Podarcis melisellensis). Small islets tend to have both a lower number of predators and less resources. Therefore, islet populations were expected to show more risk-taking behaviour and less neophobia in a foraging context. Previous studies on behaviour of urban lizards have yielded inconsistent results, but due to a lack of both predators and arthropod prey in urban habitats, we expected urban lizards to also take more risks and behave less neophobic. We sampled several inhabited and uninhabited locations on Vis (Croatia) and surrounding islets. Risk-taking behaviour was tested by measuring the latency of lizards to feed in the presence of a predator model, and neophobia by measuring the latency to feed in the presence of a novel object. We found that islet lizards do indeed take more risks and were less vigilant, but not less neophobic. Urban and rural lizards did not differ in any of these behaviours, which is in sharp contrast with previous work on mammals and birds. The behavioural differences between islet and island lizards were novel, but not unexpected findings and are in line with the theory of island tameness. The effect of urbanization on the behaviour of animals seems to be more complex and might vary among taxa.",2018,10.1111/eth.12722,provisioned,ethology,exp,Podarcis_melisellensis,lizard,reptile,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,
Stears_2015,"Stears, Keenan; Shrader, Adrian M.",Increases in food availability can tempt oribi antelope into taking greater risks at both large and small spatial scales,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Differences in food availability and predation risk can influence how herbivores use landscapes. As a result, trade-offs between costs and benefits can influence habitat and patch selection. To determine how oribi antelope, Ourebia ourebi, weigh up costs and benefits when making habitat and patch level foraging decisions, we measured giving-up densities in artificial patches. First, we determined large-scale habitat use, and then explored how different variables explained patch use within habitats. When the availability of food within patches across the different habitats was equal, oribi preferred to feed in short and tall grasslands and avoided woodlands. Furthermore, the avoidance of woodlands extended into the surrounding grasslands, resulting in oribi feeding less intensively in grassland areas within 15 m of the woodlands. Within the safe grassland habitats, oribi preferred to feed in patches close to tall grass (i.e. escape cover), and where they could see beyond 2 m. These results suggest that oribi select habitats and patches in relation to perceived predation risk (i.e. predation costs outweigh potential food intake benefits). However, when we increased food availability within woodlands, oribi increased their large-scale risk-taking behaviour and fed in these woodlands. Furthermore, this increased risk taking extended to small-scale foraging decisions whereby an increase in food availability within woodlands caused oribi to increase their relative usage of patches that had sight lines as well as patches that were closer to potential ambush sites. Ultimately, these results highlight how changes in food availability can determine the degree to which herbivores are willing to increase their risk-taking behaviour, and how these changes can affect overall landscape use.

Thornton_2012,"Thornton, Alex; Samson, Jamie",Innovative problem solving in wild meerkats,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Behavioural innovations may have far-reaching evolutionary and ecological consequences, allowing individuals to obtain new resources and cope with environmental change. However, as innovations are rarely observed in nature, their emergence is poorly understood. What drives individuals to innovate, and what psychological mechanisms allow them to do so? We used three novel food extraction tasks to address these questions in groups of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Innovatory tendencies were unrelated to body condition and foraging success, but were affected by age, rank and sex. Juvenile individuals were most likely to interact with tasks, but seldom solved them, perhaps owing to their small size or lack of dexterity. Instead, adult subordinates made up the bulk of the innovators. In cooperatively breeding societies, the inability of subordinate helpers to compete physically with dominant breeders may drive them to seek out solutions to novel problems. Most innovators were males, which, as the dispersing sex, may be particularly prone to solve novel problems, and innovators virtually always persisted longer than other group members when interacting with tasks. Most successful individuals solved tasks more than once, and learned to inhibit ineffective prepotent responses across successive presentations of the same task. They did not learn to manipulate functional parts of the apparatus more efficiently, however, nor did they extract general rules allowing them to solve novel tasks faster. Contrary to recent suggestions that innovation may be cognitively demanding, these results suggest that simple, conserved learning processes and dogged perseverance may suffice to generate solutions to novel problems.

Griesser_2016,"Griesser, Michael; Suzuki, Toshitaka N.",Kinship modulates the attention of naive individuals to the mobbing behaviour of role models,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"The social acquisition of life skills is essential in a wide range of species. Field experiments have demonstrated that naive young learn particularly from their parents how to deal with predators or how to find suitable food. However, it remains unclear whether the response of young differs in a novel situation when together with related (i.e. parents) or unrelated role models. We addressed this question in a group-living bird species, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus, groups of which can contain both related and unrelated juveniles. Groups are formed around a breeding pair which engages in prolonged parental care, facilitating delayed dispersal of offspring for up to 5 years. About 25% of juveniles are killed by predators during their first year of life, suggesting that predator avoidance is a crucial life skill for juveniles. Exposing groups to perched predator models showed that kinship influenced how juveniles responded to the mobbing behaviour of breeders. Upon exposure to a predator model, related juveniles immediately paid attention to the behaviour of breeders and copied most of their movements. In contrast, unrelated juveniles copied the behaviour of breeders less frequently, but regularly foraged in the presence of a predator model. These results show that juveniles respond differently to parents and unrelated role models, potentially affecting the acquisition of vital life skills. Parental care creates a close social bond, predisposing juveniles to pay attention especially to novel behaviours shown by their caregivers. Furthermore, parents have a fitness benefit from facilitating the skill acquisition of their offspring. Thus, a prolonged parent-offspring association is likely to enhance skill acquisition and influence cognitive evolution across species. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We conducted an open diffusion field experiment with 13 groups of wild common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus. Seven groups contained individuals that were already familiar with the task ('push or pull' box) and thus served as potential models for naive individuals. Additionally, in four groups one individual was trained for one of the two possible techniques and in two control groups no skilled individuals were present. First, we investigated whether experienced individuals would remember how to solve the task even after 2 years without exposure and whether they would still prefer their learned technique. Second, we tested whether naive individuals would learn socially from their skilled family members and, more importantly, whether they would use the same technique. Third, we conducted several test blocks to see whether the individual and/or group behaviour would persist over time. Our results show that wild common marmosets were able to memorize, learn socially and maintain preferences of foraging techniques. This field experiment thus reveals a promising approach to studying social learning in the wild and provides the basis for long-term studies on tradition formation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We examined whether moonlight levels and the presence or absence of rodent shelter affect rodent seed removal (rate, handling time and time of removal) and seed selection (size and species) among seven oak species. The presence or absence of safe microhabitats was found to be more important than moonlight levels in the removal of seeds. Bright moonlight caused a different temporal distribution of seed removal throughout the night but only affected the overall removal rates in open microhabitats. Seeds were removed more rapidly in open microhabitat (regardless of the moon phase), decreasing the time allocated to seed discrimination and translocation. Only in open microhabitats did increasing levels of moonlight decrease the time allocated to selection and removal of seeds. As a result, a more precise seed selection was made under shelter, owing to lower levels of predation risk. Rodent ranking preference for species was identical between full/new moon in shelter but not in open microhabitats. For all treatments, species selection by rodents was much stronger than size selection. Nevertheless, heavy seeds, which require more energy and time to be transported, were preferentially removed under shelter, where there is no time restriction to move the seeds. Our findings reveal that seed selection is safety dependent and, therefore, microhabitats in which seeds are located (sheltered versus exposed) and moonlight levels in open areas should be taken into account in rodent food selection studies.

Here, we tested this hypothesis with a field experiment that directly compared subjects' immediate variation in measures of current energy balance with their interest in a novel foraging problem, liquid honey enclosed in an apparatus accessible by tool use. We found that the previous distance traveled directly predicted subjects' manipulations of both the apparatus and the tool, whereas previous feeding time was negatively correlated to manipulation time. We conclude that necessity augments chimpanzees' likelihood of engaging with ecological opportunities, suggesting that both factors are scaffolding foraging innovation in this and potentially other species.",2019,10.1093/beheco/arz062,provisioned,ethology,exp,Pan_troglodytes,primate,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,
Kaczorowski_2016,"Kaczorowski, Rainee L.; Markman, Shai",Nectar alkaloids of tree tobacco can reduce Palestine sunbird foraging performance in a colour discrimination task,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Many plant species contain plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), such as alkaloids, in their tissues for protection against herbivore attack, but PSMs can also be found in floral nectar. Some pollinators have been shown to discriminate against floral nectar with PSMs and consuming PSMs may have negative fitness effects on pollinators. However, only a few studies have investigated the effects of ecologically relevant levels of PSMs on pollinator foraging performance. Here, we addressed the question of whether the natural concentrations of the alkaloids, nicotine and anabasine, found in tree tobacco, Nicotiana glauca, nectar affect foraging performance in Palestine sunbird, Nectarinia osea, pollinators that use the plant's nectar as a food source. We trained foraging sunbirds to discriminate between rewarding and nonrewarding artificial flowers based on colour. We measured sunbird foraging performance through their accuracy at distinguishing the two colours immediately after training (pretreatment), and again the following day after consuming sucrose solutions with or without alkaloids (post-treatment). We also explored other potential effects of PSM consumption by assessing bird activity level and flower visit rate. Birds that consumed alkaloids did not significantly change their activity level or flower visit rate across time (pre- and post-treatment) compared to birds that did not consume alkaloids (no significant time by treatment interaction). However, alkaloid consumption significantly decreased sunbird foraging performance in terms of their accuracy in distinguishing the rewarding colour, potentially due to reduced memory retention and/or other cognitive or physiological impairments following alkaloid consumption. We also found that sunbirds discriminated against higher, in favour of lower, ecologically relevant alkaloid concentrations in the nectar of tree tobacco and that previous exposure to alkaloids reduced overall consumption of alkaloid solutions. Reduced foraging performance due to PSM ingestion could greatly affect a pollinator's foraging efficiency, which could, in turn, affect both pollinator and plant reproductive fitness.

This is important for snakes, where an ambush site has suitable ambience. We studied the foraging strategy of the Palestine Saw-scaled Viper (Echis coloratus) at an avian migratory stopover site. Following initial observations, we hypothesized that vipers are able to discern the body mass of a perched bird and hunt accordingly. We implemented an experiment where vipers chose between four groups of migratory Blackcaps with different body mass. Prey choice by vipers of both age classes was not random and adults focused on Blackcaps with the lightest body mass. juveniles displayed a variability of prey choice but selected mainly birds from the lightest categories. We concluded that Saw-scaled Vipers hunt prey based on thermal cues; juveniles practice on different prey groups prior to perfecting their foraging techniques i.e., hunting is a learned process; and that they prefer birds with the lowest body mass. The last because Blackcaps, when on migration, save energy by entering a state of deep torpor in which they sacrifice their vigilance capabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although the use of social foraging tactics is partly flexible, yet some individuals tend to produce more, whereas others largely prefer to scrounge. This between-individual variation in tactic use closely resembles the phenomenon of animal personality; however, the connection between personality and social foraging tactic use has rarely been investigated in wild animals. Here, we studied this relationship in free-living Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) during 2 winters. We found that in females, but not in males, social foraging tactic use was predicted by personality: more exploratory (i.e., more active in a novel environment) females scrounged more. Regardless of sex, the probability of scrounging increased with the density of individuals foraging on feeders and the time of feeding within a foraging bout, that is, the later the individual foraged within a foraging bout the higher the probability of scrounging was. Our results demonstrate that consistent individual behavioral differences are linked, in a sex-dependent manner, to group-level processes in the context of social foraging in free-living tree sparrows, suggesting that individual behavioral traits have implications for social evolution.",2019,10.1093/beheco/arz026,provisioned,ethology,obs,Passer_montanus,passserine,bird,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,
McArthur_2019,"McArthur, Clare; Finnerty, Patrick B.; Schmitt, Melissa H.; Shuttleworth, Adam; Shrader, Adrian M.",Plant volatiles are a salient cue for foraging mammals: elephants target preferred plants despite background plant odour,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"To forage nonrandomly, animals must discriminate among food items. Foods differ in look, smell and taste, providing cues for foragers with appropriate senses. Irrespective of the sensory modality, however, foragers can only use cues effectively if they can detect sensory signals above background noise. Recent evidence shows that foraging mammalian herbivores can detect plant odours, but their capacity to select preferred plants in a noisy olfactory background is unknown. Using choice trials, we tested whether the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, uses plant odour as a salient cue despite increasingly complex and challenging background odours. We first established their preference for familiar plant species. We then tested their capacity to discriminate and select preferred plants based on odour alone. We found that elephants successfully chose preferred species even when presented with complex background odours from nonpreferred plants mimicking multispecies vegetation patches. Elephants also succeeded despite our attempt to mask distinguishing odours with large amounts of a synthetic green leaf volatile. GC-MS analysis confirmed that volatile organic compound profiles differed between plant species. In demonstrating that elephants exploit plant odours even when the signal from preferred plants is embedded in sensory noise of background odours, we provide crucial behavioural evidence that olfaction provides an efficient mechanism for selective, nonrandom foraging. Whether mammalian herbivores recognize novel odours, for example from newly invading plant species, or when air pollution degrades odours of familiar plants, needs investigating. Accounting for the capacity of mammalian herbivores to use plant odour cues will improve models of both their foraging behaviour and the ecosystem impacts of their foraging.

We used handheld infrared video cameras to obtain c. 6 hours of video footage of kiwi over 19 months. Kiwi used native forest and exotic pasture habitats while active at night and spent most of their time foraging (75%). Prey capture rates were significantly higher in pasture than forest. The remaining 25% of time was spent walking, vigilant, engaged in comfort behaviours, escaping disturbance, and investigating obstacles. Direct social and courtship interactions were observed rarely. The senses of hearing, olfaction and touch seemed most important to kiwi. Touch was used for investigating terrain and negotiating obstacles. Hearing was used in response to sounds made by observers, conspecifics and other sources. Olfactory search behaviours (OSBs) were used in the direction of these sounds, and olfaction was also apparently used to assess odours on the ground.

Evans_2021a,"Evans, Andrew W.; Williams, Dana M.; Blumstein, Daniel T.",Producer-scrounger relationships in yellow-bellied marmots,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"When social animals forage together, they may engage in frequency-dependent strategies either as producers, those who acquire food with their own energy, or as scroungers, those who feed on what the producers discover. An individual's choice of strategy may depend on the frequency of strategies within the group, or it may depend on the individual's own traits. Most of our understanding of producer-scrounger relationships comes from highly social species, but we may gain different insights by studying less social species. We used novel puzzle box experiments to study social foraging relationships and identify the traits associated with strategy choice in facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found that marmots had consistent strategies as either producers or scroungers. Furthermore, several individuals specialized as scroungers, following the producers to the puzzle box before other scroungers. However, their roles were only associated with sex (males were more likely to produce), and not with age, boldness or dominance rank. Marmots' lack of trait-regulated foraging roles may be associated with their relatively abundant and not-entirely defensible food, or may emerge from their lack of obligate social structure. We discuss how multiple factors may explain variation in social foraging behaviour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ayon_2017,"Ayon, Rey E.; Putman, Breanna J.; Clark, Rulon W.",Recent encounters with rattlesnakes enhance ground squirrel responsiveness to predator cues,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"A diverse range of prey taxa exhibit stereotyped antipredator behaviors when confronting live predators. Predator cues also elicit antipredator responses, and previous research indicates that prey possess mechanisms to discriminate between the relative risk posed by particular predator cues, which mediates their investment in antipredator behaviors (i.e., Bthreatsensitive behavior). However, the salience of such predator cues may change according to perceived predation risk, which can vary temporally or spatially. We hypothesized that prey modify responses to predatory cues according to their recent experience with predators, which would prime prey to attend to predator-related cues. In the present study, we found that recent encounters with live tethered rattlesnakes increased perceived predation risk in free-ranging California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi), leading to concomitant increases in the intensity of antipredator behaviors displayed toward a predator model. The increase in antipredator behavior following snake encounters was higher toward the predator model than a novel object, suggesting that squirrels exhibit threat-sensitive responses toward objects resembling predators. However, squirrels did not treat either of these objects with caution, nor did they differ in antipredator behavior, when presented with the model or novel object when no live snake was encountered. This suggests that increased vigilance following predator encounters modulates responses to predator cues. Such increases in antipredator behavior could assist in detecting nearby predators quickly but could also have indirect effects on prey. Significance statement Underresponding to predators could lead to death, while overresponding could reduce time spent on other fitnessrelated activities. Prey balance these costs by using environmental cues to modify antipredator responses. Detecting a live predator in the environment could indicate that the chance of predation is high, which may enhance preys' antipredator responses. We show that ground squirrels significantly enhance antipredator behaviors toward snake models and novel objects after encountering a live tethered rattlesnake predator. However, the predator model elicited greater antipredator behavior than the novel object following snake encounters, suggesting that squirrels are primed to attend to predator-related cues in this context. Both objects were treated similarly, and with less caution, when no snake was detected. Vigilance following predator interactions therefore mediates threatsensitive responses to subsequent predator cues.",2017,10.1007/s00265-017-2378-1,provisioned,ethology,exp,Otospermophilus_beecheyi,rodent,mammal,"direct_obs, PROVISIONED",,,,,270,,,,,,

Couchoux_2018,"Couchoux, Charline; Clermont, Jeanne; Garant, Dany; Reale, Denis",Signaler and receiver boldness influence response to alarm calls in eastern chipmunks,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Using social information can benefit individuals in many ways. Responding to alarm signals can, for instance, maximize survival under predation risk. However, foraging individuals should consider the reliability of such risk-based information to balance antipredator behavior and resource acquisition. Receiver decisions could depend on personality effects, as individual variation in risk-taking tendencies (i.e., boldness) could not only affect receiver perception of the signaled threat but also signaler reliability. Recent theoretical models support the possibility of coevolution between personality and communication strategies. Using a playback experiment, we show that wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) respond to alarm calls according to their own boldness level (measured as consistent individual differences in basal vigilance) and that they increase their vigilance response to bolder callers potentially considered as more reliable. Further, receivers respond to the callers' boldness regardless of their own boldness and independently of their familiarity level with callers, therefore decoding this information from vocalizations. Such effects of individual behavioral variation on the perception and interpretation of social information could apply to signals used in a variety of ecological contexts.",2018,10.1093/beheco/arx152,provisioned,ethology,exp,Tamias_striatus,rodent,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,
Blumstein_2017,"Blumstein, Daniel T.; Fuong, Holly; Palmer, Elizabeth",Social security: social relationship strength and connectedness influence how marmots respond to alarm calls,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Individuals vary in the number and types of social relationships they maintain. If beneficial, social relationships may reduce predation risk and thus increase an individual's sense of security. We tested this hypothesis by studying the responses of female yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) to broadcast alarm calls from unfamiliar individuals. First, we quantified affiliative interactions of animals in the field to calculate a set of social network measures. Because attributes of sociality are often correlated, we used principal component analysis to reduce our social network metrics to two unrelated factors and used the social network measure that accounted for the most variance for each principal component in further analyses. We then quantified the change in time allocated to vigilance and foraging following alarm call playback from baseline levels to the first 30 s and the second 30 s period (i.e., 31-60 s) following playback. We expected that if marmots with strong affiliative relationships felt more secure, they would forage more and allocate less time to vigilance after their immediate vigilance response to the broadcast alarm calls. Using mixed effects models that controlled for variation explained by a number of biologically important covariates and permutation tests to test the significance of social network variables, we found that marmots with a higher incloseness allocated significantly more time to vigilance in both the first and second 30 s after hearing a novel alarm call. Additionally, and while not significant (the observed parameter estimate fell between the 90 and 95% CI), marmots with a higher outstrength increased foraging in the second 30 s after hearing a novel alarmcall. If we assume that time allocated to foraging is a measure of security, then marmots with strong affiliative relationships reacted more to an alarm call from a novel individual and seemingly felt more secure than their counterparts. Our results, therefore, suggest that strong social relationships increase perceptions of security and illustrate an effect of social relationships on predation risk assessment. Significance statement In many species, including humans, there are benefits from maintaining good social relationships. These benefits include better health and greater longevity. We studied yellow-bellied marmots, a ground-dwelling squirrel that is notable because it has variable social relationships. Capitalizing on this social variation, we found that marmots that maintain strong affiliative relationships with other marmots may indeed forage more after hearing an artificially broadcast alarm call than marmots with weaker affiliative relationships. This result suggests that marmots that are more socially connected with others in their group may feel relatively more secure, possibly because they have others that can help them assess risk, and that a benefit of maintaining strong friendly social ties is that it permits animals to forage more. Thus, we suggest a new way that social relationships can be beneficial: they increase perceptions of security and this ultimatelymay facilitate foraging.",2017,10.1007/s00265-017-2374-5,provisioned,ethology,obs,Marmota_flaviventer,rodent,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,
Billings_2017,"Billings, Alexis C.; Greene, Erick; MacArthur-Waltz, Dylan",Steller's jays assess and communicate about predator risk using detection cues and identity,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Predators can vary in the risk they pose, depending upon the factors such as body size, maneuverability, hunting strategy, and diet. Prey can also detect predators with different senses, such as seeing, hearing, or smelling them. We presented wild Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri annectens) with visual cues (robotic raptors) or acoustic cues (call playbacks) of 4 different raptors to test how they assess risk and how this influences their alarm calls. The assessment of risk from different predator cues varied with different species of raptors: Jays responded to sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) with an increase in latency to resume foraging regardless of whether they were seen or heard, whereas latency responses to northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) were longer if they were seen versus if they were heard. Furthermore, Steller's jays altered the acoustic structure of their alarm calls depending on the species of raptor and whether they saw or heard them. These results demonstrate that Steller's jay's assessment of risk involves an interaction between predator identity and predator detection cue and in response, they alter their acoustically-simple alarm calls in surprisingly nuanced ways.",2017,10.1093/beheco/arx035,provisioned,ethology,exp,Cyanocitta_stelleri,passerine,bird,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,

Anecdotal observations have led to the general prediction that the auditory sensory mode is the most prominent for the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), a nocturnal, insectivorous canid. The present study aimed to clarify the relative importance of different sensory modes to foraging bat-eared foxes by conducting sensory trials with individuals belonging to a habituated population in the Kuruman River Reserve in South Africa. Foxes were tested in repeated trials controlling for particular sensory stimuli using live or pre-killed prey. Auditory cues proved significant (p <= 0.01) predictors of fox foraging success with olfactory and visual cues indicated as being of secondary importance. This study thus provides empirical confirmation for anecdotal reports that the bat-eared fox is predominantly reliant on auditory cues to determine hunting success.",2017,10.1163/1568539X-00003419,provisioned,ethology,exp,Otocyon_megalotis,carnivore,mammal,PROVISIONED,4,,,,,,,,,,

We simultaneously measured parental provisioning and foraging behavior in a free-living population of Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) using an electronic monitoring system. We fitted 145 adults with a passive transponder tag and remotely recorded their visits to nest boxes and feeders continuously over a 2-month period. After validating the accuracy of this monitoring system, we studied how provisioning and foraging activities varied through time (day and breeding cycle) and influenced the benefits (food received by the offspring) and costs (interclutch interval) of parental care. The provisioning rates of wild Zebra Finches were surprisingly low, with an average of only one visit per hour throughout the day. This was significantly lower than those reported for this model species in captivity and for most other passerines in the wild. Nest visitation rate only partially explained the amount of food received by the young, with parental foraging activity, including the minimum distance covered on foraging trips, being better predictors. Parents that sustained higher foraging activity and covered more distance during the first breeding attempt took longer to renest. These results demonstrate that in some species matching foraging activity with offspring provisioning may provide a better estimate of the true investment that individuals commit to a reproductive attempt.

Morrison_2011,"Morrison, Emily B.",Vigilance behavior of a tropical bird in response to indirect and direct cues of predation risk,BEHAVIOUR,"Animals use a variety of cues to evaluate their risk of predation when foraging, including direct cues of predator presence such as vocalizations or scent, and indirect cues, or environmental correlates of predation risk, such as vegetation structure. Research took place in a large-scale forest restoration experiment where habitat patches of different sizes were planted. I examined the effects of predator vocalizations (direct cues) on the vigilance behavior of Cherrie's Tanagers (Ramphocelus costaricensis) foraging in three different locations with varying amounts of vegetation cover (indirect cues): small patches and the centers and edges of large patches. Results show that the indirect cue of predation risk mediated birds' response to the direct cue. The increase in time birds spent alert in response to the predator call was significantly greater in the presumably riskier small patches and large patch edges compared to the relatively safe large patch centers. The increase in frequency of head-turns also was significantly greater in small patches compared to the large patch centers in response to the predator call. Although birds recognized the threat of the predator call and reacted by fleeing more quickly than after the non-predator call, this response did not differ between locations. Birds appeared to integrate information from both types of cues to evaluate their predation risk and determine their vigilance response. Individuals responded more strongly to the direct cue of predation risk when foraging in the presumably riskier smaller patches and large patch edges by increasing vigilance. These results highlight the importance of investigating behavioral responses to the characteristics of forest restoration sites, many of which consist of small patches of habitat.",2011,10.1163/000579511X589316,provisioned,ethology,exp,Ramphocelus_costaricensis,passerine,bird,"direct_obs, playback, PROVISIONED",,,,,,,,,,,
Schmitt_2018,"Schmitt, Melissa H.; Shuttleworth, Adam; Ward, David; Shrader, Adrian M.",African elephants use plant odours to make foraging decisions across multiple spatial scales,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Mammalian herbivores are known to be extremely selective when foraging, but little is known about the mechanisms governing the selection of patches and, at a finer scale, individual plants. Visual examination and direct sampling of the vegetation have previously been suggested, but olfactory cues have seldom been considered. We examined the use of olfactory cues by foraging African elephants, Loxodonta africana, and asked whether they use plant odours to select specific patches or plants when making feeding decisions. Scent-based choice experiments between various preferred and nonpreferred plants were conducted across two spatial scales (between plants and between patches). We used coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of headspace extracts of volatile organic compounds emitted by the different plant species to explore similarities among the overall odour profiles of each species. We found that elephants selected their preferred plant species across both spatial scales, probably using differences in plant odour profiles. The ability to differentiate between plant odours allowed elephants to reduce their search time by targeting preferred plant species both within a feeding station and between patches. This suggests that olfactory cues probably play an important role in driving herbivore foraging decisions across multiple spatial scales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Iglesias_2012,"Iglesias, T. L.; McElreath, R.; Patricelli, G. L.",Western scrub-jay funerals: cacophonous aggregations in response to dead conspecifics,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"All organisms must contend with the risk of injury or death; many animals reduce this danger by assessing environmental cues to avoid areas of elevated risk. However, little is known about how organisms respond to one of the most salient visual cues of risk: a dead conspecific. Here we show that the sight of a dead conspecific is sufficient to induce alarm calling and subsequent risk-reducing behavioural modification in western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica, and is similar to the response to a predator (a great horned owl, Bubo virginianus, model). Discovery of a dead conspecific elicits vocalizations that are effective at attracting conspecifics, which then also vocalize, thereby resulting in a cacophonous aggregation. Presentations of prostrate dead conspecifics and predator mounts elicited aggregations and hundreds of long-range communication vocalizations, while novel objects did not. In contrast to presentations of prostrate dead conspecifics, presentations of a jay skin mounted in an upright, life-like pose elicited aggressive responses, suggesting the mounted scrub-jay was perceived to be alive and the prostrate jay was not. There was a decrease of foraging in the area during presentations of prostrate dead conspecifics and predator mounts, which was still detectable 24 h later. Foraging returned to baseline levels 48 h after presentations. Novel objects and mounted jays did not affect foraging. Our results show that without witnessing the struggle and manner of death, the sight of a dead conspecific is used as public information and that this information is actively shared with conspecifics and used to reduce exposure to risk.

We therefore know little about intrapopulation variation in cognitive or behavioral flexibility under different conditions of anthropogenic exposure. Here, we investigate object exploration and behavioral flexibility in a single group of samango monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) in an environment in which individuals forage in both gardens and natural forest. Over 2 months, we presented monkeys with novel, human-made objects in both natural and disturbed areas, varying the position of objects in trees to represent exposed or safer foraging zones. We video-recorded and analyzed interactions with these novel objects, assessing interaction times (an indicator of persistence), exploratory diversity (or motor diversity), and the occurrence of foraging innovations. Results from 67 interactions (29 in natural habitats and 38 in disturbed) indicate that samango monkeys exhibited a spatially complex response to novel objects: in contrast to that in other species, exploration diversity decreased significantly in anthropogenic environments, even as persistence remained largely static across contexts. Monkeys also exhibited foraging innovations by pulling on strings to bring objects closer. This may reduce exposure to danger, as string-pulling was most prevalent in the highest risk condition (ground level in human gardens). Significant intrapopulation variation in behavioral flexibility suggests that samango monkeys adjust the expression of problem-solving behaviors in relation to the degree of human disturbance in their immediate environment.",2019,10.1007/s10764-019-00113-x,provisioned,audio video,exp,Cercopithecus_mitis,primate,mammal,PROVISIONED,,,,,,,,,,,
